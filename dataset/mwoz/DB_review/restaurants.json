Let me regale you with a tale of culinary adventure at the Hut of Pizza.The Quest for the Cheesy GrailOnce upon a recent Tuesday, I embarked on a quest for the fabled Cheesy Grail, a mythical pizza said to contain the perfect ratio of cheese to crust. The journey was fraught with peril, as I navigated the treacherous terrains of the great menu and decided to order my flumongous choiceThe Arrival of the Saucy SteedLo and behold, a steed of steel (also known as a delivery scooter) arrived, bearing the treasure chest (pizza box, that is). With bated breath, I lifted the lid to gaze upon the golden bounty... only to find the Cheeseburger Pizza staring back. A fusion of fast food royalty and Italian zest, it was a sight to behold.The Feast of KingsAs I took my first bite, the heavens parted, and the angels sang\u2014or perhaps it was just the sound of my own contented munching. The crust, a buttery bastion of flavor, held the toppings like a king cradles his crown jewels. The cheese stretched with each bite, creating strings of deliciousness that could've lassoed the moon.The AftermathIn the end, the pizza was vanquished, leaving behind only memories and a greasy box as a testament to the glorious battle. I sat back, a conqueror, my hunger sated, my taste buds jubilant, and my heart full\u2014both metaphorically and quite literally.In conclusion, Pizza Hut, you've done it again. You've taken the humble ingredients of flour, cheese, and tomato sauce and turned them into a feast fit for jesters and kings alike. Bravo! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udf55",

I've had to think hard about what to write as I want to be fair.We chose the Missing sock as it is a bit alternative, it has a large outdoor space, on-site bedrooms and very fairly priced. We were happy with our initial interactions with the events organiser, but unfortunately the venue passed management/ownership multiple times. We went through 4 different event organisers. The communication was very poor, and there seemed to be little/No organisation. The day before the wedding the events organiser was out of the country and the person covering them knew nothing about our plan for the day.They tried to change us additional fees the day before the wedding, they had not kept a  record of the payments we had made to them. They charged us a \u00a3200 fee for booking an external pizza van, despite the fact they had failed to book one themselves (we had been told months earlier that this had been taken care of).When we arrived to start setting up we had to get the tables out of the muddy field. The tables were in poor condition and they did not have table cloths as promised. The chairs had been in storage and were dirty and mismatched. The patio in the marquee was filthy and littered with cigarette butts. There were initials of a previous couple painted on the decking.Despite the stress of the above issues, on the day the staff worked hard, the home made BBQ and sides were delicious, and we had a lovely time. The bedroom we stayed in was comfy and clean. Having the teepees for guests to sleep in is a big plus.Its such a shame as they have a great space and so much potential but their lack of organisation, communication and care needs serious work.",

Debilitating music kept us from relaxing, the door to the restroom was carelessly opened. Was pleased to have the opportunity to order online via QR code, there you can also pay for it and leave a tip. But the waiter's service leaves much to be desired. Maybe the waiter was feeling ill or something, but he made 2 mistakes in our small order, didn't bring soup and gave a different salad. But we still left him a good tip. Always leave a tip for the waiters and delivery guys.",

Our \"view\" from our balcony was a wall and the air conditioning would not keep up.  We were able to stay mostly comfortable with a fan that we found in the closet, but it did make the lights flicker. I will say that it was a pretty quiet location and the staff was quite nice.  The food and drink weren't interesting at allRooms: The room was nice enough with some strange organization, but pretty generic.  It was not nice enough to justify the cost, in my opinion.Nearby activities: This hotel gives easy access to many local attractions and shopping areas within a 15 minute walk.Food & drinks: We only ate breakfast, and it was simply pretty generic.

This wasn't really is use during our winter stay however I could imagine it being great during summer.Stayed in the Lombard suite which was roomy, clean and well stocked. Only minor criticisms are that the Lombard suite is quite dark and the ceiling lighting is not good. This room would be transformed if the main chandelier was swapped for spotlights.

I wasn\u2019t expecting much but when they turned up they looked as amazing as they tasted.Thin, long, crispy and salty with a great aioli dip.Filo Prawns 8/10Saw the people next to me have these and had to ask which ones they were on the menu. Again, they looked as delicious as they tasted. Never had prawns in this style aside from tempura but this was like a thin crispy pastry wrapping. It tasted amazing and had a great crunch.MAINS:Roasted Aubergine 8/10We were in two minds about ordering this or the gnocchi but really glad we tried this. Turned up looking well presented. Good texture and nice glaze.Black Pepper Vegetarian Chicken 9/10Really tasty and loved the peppery flavour. The mock meat used was a great consistency as well - not too chewy.We did expect these two plates to be slightly larger portion sizes than they were (especially after seeing the pasta portion sizes and the prices).Overall a really great meal and a super nice ambience too!

They have daily specials, including $2 tacos on Taco Tuesdays. We also appreciated that they have a menu option for the doggos, a small bowl with meat and egg, which they scarfed down happily. Our server was very nice and brought the dogs some bowls for water.We sat on the patio, which was a spacious open area under a tent. The inside of the bar was very lively with karaoke, but the patio was more quiet and relaxed, which was nice. One downside however is the patio area looks over the highway, so it's not the most scenic view. That said, it's a minor gripe considering how affordable the menu is.",

The setting feels both casual and elegant, making it ideal for breakfast, a casual tea break, or a light Mediterranean-inspired meal.We visited for breakfast and tea before embarking on another walk around the beautiful city, and it was an excellent start to the day. The menu offers a nice variety of Mediterranean dishes, and everything we ordered was fresh, flavorful, and well-presented. The breakfast selection was particularly good, with options that cater to both traditional and more adventurous tastes. We enjoyed our tea as well, served in a relaxed manner that allowed us to linger and enjoy the lovely view of the college across the street.The service was friendly and attentive without being intrusive, which made the experience even more pleasant. The staff ensured we were comfortable and had everything we needed without any rush, making it easy to enjoy the moment. The cafe's location is perfect for anyone looking to take in the sights of Cambridge, as it is situated in a bustling area that is still peaceful enough for a quiet meal.Overall, The Copper Kettle is a wonderful spot for anyone visiting Cambridge, especially if you're looking for a charming, light-filled space to enjoy a leisurely meal.

The walls were painted with bright colors and the space between seating was more than adequate. There were well placed bar stools in front of the windows also.The food is where the wheels started to come off. I ordered a custom bowl with rice and bulgogi. Among my choices, I had regular kimchee, their version of oi-sobagi (cucumber kim chee), and some odeng (fish cake). Both Kim chee dishes had mild heat and acid with just enough flavor to make it passable as a kim chee. The odeng, although the right sponginess, didn't have much flavor to it at all. Those items I could deal with. The real issue for me was that both the bulgogi and rice were both very cold and almost flavorless. I'm unsure of the style of Korean inspired food but I'm accustomed to warm/hot meats and rice with cold sides that have spicy heat. I finished my food because it wasn't terrible; it was just bland.",

It was delicious, I've never had purple rice before but it's pretty good. My friend had a beef bulgogi burrito, I did try it but I prefer the rice bowl, really just based on my taste preference. I will say there are generous amounts of protein in each one, they don't go overkill on the sides as make their portions look big. Portion size is great. For an online order we also appreciate they were able to accommodate our requests, putting the sour cream & poco in containers on the side. We actually got a free mandu as a promotion, those were good too with the ponzu sauce.The lady working was super nice, the place was clean, & they have fast service.

I ended up getting the purple rice as my base and the bulgogi as my protein. You can choose 5 toppings; I went with the edamame, green onions, corn, radish, and cucumbers. Some of the ingredients didn't look the freshest, but that's a typical downside of BYOB places in lieu of convenience. (Everything still tasted good though). For sauces, I went with the employees recommendation of yum yum sauce and gochujang.Aside from the BYOB bar, they also have menu items to pick from. I decided to try the Budae Jjigae (Army Stew). I ordered it to go and was impressed by how neatly everything was packed. The noodles and cheese were put in a separate container from the soup to prevent them from getting over cooked and soggy. The aroma from both items I ordered smelled so good and tempting as I was driving home. It was delicious and comforting!",

We're locals and were looking forward to another great restaurant but Blue Mezze didn't live up to the expectations.Food: The best item we had was the watermelon salad. It was refreshing and the tomatoes were a nice touch. The falafel felt dry and under seasoned. In our mezze we got the Muhammara, Hummus, and Tzatziki. They were okay, nothing too memorable about them. The pita bread that came with it was delicious. Freshly made and well seasoned. The only main entree they had that was vegetarian was the truffle pasta. It was okay.Service: Service was rude and abrupt and impatient. I understand that they are busy but less than 5 minutes after we were seated they kept trying to rush us to order and once we ordered we didn't see our server until it was time to order our main entrees. It was so hard to get our water filled or even catch someone to order more food/drinks.Ambiance: It's got a great vibe. I love the decor and definitely feels like a fancy restaurant. They also have a live DJ which I think is really cool.Price: Given the service and quality of the food, this whole meal felt very over priced. Despite it's great ambiance, it is not worth the price. The food portions for the pasta was not big at all, it could barely fill one person and was costing more than $20.Insta: @TheShahLALand",

There was both ambient music, and a live sax player (please pick one and don't have both going simultaneously).The tables are crowded pretty closely together which adds to the somewhat oppressive noise and general chaos of the place. We were elbow to elbow against tables on either side and all parties had to raise their voices to compete with the noise. The sax player had to weave between tables, often through very narrow pathways.It finally started emptying out toward the end of our meal.The food was just okay. The cream of crab soup I got was tasty but had no pieces of crab in it and was very thin. My garlic spinach was unremarkable and too salty. My friend got a sampler plate with cheese and the cheese seemed like it was just standard grocery store cheese.The servers seemed to be mostly checked out and were pretty forgetful.

I came in November and it was too cold for us to sit outside. We were given a two person seat pretty quickly and they have one large table for parties of 6 to 8 people.We ordered the fondue with truffle oil, the burger and the octopus which was grilled. The burger was simply incredible I know that\u2019s the last thing that you should order but it was actually really good. So if you decide to make a part of your order you won\u2019t be disappointed. We did like the cheese fondue a lot but it is very filling and impossible to finish. Tasted great though. The octopus was not that delicious and I will probably skip it the next time. It does come with navy beans and loses a bit of the charred grilledness.The wait stuff was really good, they made good recommendations and were the ones who recommended the cheese fondue to us.

When she served the burger, she had made sure that the dressing, coleslaw and onion rings (as my wife had them) were served separately as the dressing had tomato in it and the coleslaw had raw onion in it, l hadn't asked for this, Alexandra took it upon herself to arrange my burger like this and thought this was amazing service.

Spaghetti is not freshly or home made (no surprise) but the mushroom/cheese/cream sauce was pretty good but nothing special/memorable.  The quality and quantity of ingredients on top of the pizza tasted very good and looked very appealing \u2014 nice tomatoes, mushroom, onion, ham, pepperoni all good.  Weird: celery was added as a topping\u2026 consuming at least 1000 pizzas in my life across many countries, never seen that before.  I\u2019ve nothing against celery, but it\u2019s not a pizza topping!  No harm though.  Now, crust is a personal thing, to me this one was just a \u201cslice of white bread\u201d  (see photo) with no taste or structure.  Limp bread.  Still, overall the thing tasted pretty good.  Kudos to the staff who worked very hard and stayed pleasant, they were short staffed but kept things running well.  The cute stone cabin with live fireplace is so nice and quaint, love it, BUT what is the allowable occupancy of this place?  After awhile, customers  were tripping all over each other (literally, people unavoidably stepping on toes and elbowing people) so while cozy, it was actually pushing unsafe as there is no control person at the door and people just kept coming in unchecked into a very small place with only one door in use.  Maybe fix this, especially with a fireplace at the center of the throng, these are the types of things that are \u201call good and merry\u201d until something happens.  Overall, an interesting place with nice staff and pretty good food where the pizza will appeal to some and will not be true pizza to others.Wheelchair accessibility: With wall to wall people allowed inside to wait on little stools between tables, it may be difficult to use a wheelchair inside.",

Lost a bit of the nice dining experience. I would say the food prices are in the upper end of the pricing scale for Indian food. The biggest change is adding a 10% service charge on your bill without warning. I\u2019m always happy to tip good service but don\u2019t like the mandatory service charge added and then having to ask it to be removed. They added over \u00a315 to our bill which was unacceptable.",

Nice huge fish. More special than other dishes and feels healthier. The broth is sour-spicy and quite refreshing. There\u2019s also some cabbage and veggie. Wish I had chopsticks tho.

The stir fry tofu tastes good but on the salty side as are the curries here.\u2014 202405Still thinking 4.5 for a bowl of rice is ridiculous. Red Curry is less salty this time fortunately. Beef is tender, with slices of butternut squash (personally I prefer chunky ones but it\u2019s alright). Tofu looks nice too.The ice tea is also the slimmest I\u2019ve seen.\u2014-Panang Duck Curry is the most frequent main I order. I love the tender marinated skin-on duck breast pieces. The duck meat portion is generous, even more than the veggies. (Having been to places where potato and other fillers occupy the bowl I think this is decent.) The curry is rich but not too heavy. The only downside is I can literally taste salt\u2026And a bowl of rice for 4.5 is unimaginable/unacceptable for an Asian restaurant.\ud83d\ude39 Sometimes I just order mango rice dessert instead (sadly they refuse to substitute the ice cream flavor).Papaya carrot salad is really spicy, in a good way.Soup noodle and fried rice also look nice.Fish cake is less interesting and can be quite greasy.Depending on the hour the place can be cozy or snuggling or crowded. Service is friendly and prompt. Not my favorite in Cambridge, but duck curry isn\u2019t so common here. Next time I\u2019ll see if they will heed my less salt request..",

It's been two years since I arrived and not even once I tried it, so I made up my mind to visit it and give it a try, finally.But this place isn't really for me, I guess. After trying a lot of different places, I find it not really on par with its reputation. I've tried better places (yes, not only one) with a better queue system, better service, and most importantly: better value for money!I came here around 13:00, and it wasn't the best time to come here. Too many people and the queue is just so messy. Not to mention, there was this bunch of new students who took a very long time to decide what they wanted to eat. Then, I had to wait a bit as well because apparently people who ordered before me didn't hear it when the staff was calling their name. If only they had a better way to arrange their customers during the peak time, maybe I'll give it a better rating. Taste wise, their porchetta is good, super good!I really recommend you to get something with porchetta if you come here, but then... if you're hungry and in a hurry, maybe you don't really want to go here.Usually the panino will cost you around 4.5 for the simplest one to 6\u20ac-ish for the more complicated one. Then if you ask for a maxi size (the bigger one), expect to pay 2-2.5\u20ac more.Another tip: if you can't find a panini that suits your taste, just order any topping that you want and they'll give it to you. I personally just customize everything.",

I had a wonderful stay and even book another room for my other family member. We all have a wonderful stay. It's 20 minutes by bus to central Cambridge (with near and accesible bus stop), you can find a few cafe and restaurant, there's one Sainsbury's nearby, and a communal park. The neighbourhood is quiet, cozy, and comfortable. There's also a communal work place in the lobby. The room was lovely, it had everything you need and more. I love the kithcen area and all the amenities provided. The room decor was lovely and very spacious for two. All the receptionist was friendly and helped us a lot. The only negative review I had was the bathroom on unit 2062 was a bit moldy on some corner. Like.. black mold. It was an eyesore, and there were some other dustry corner here and there. It could be cleaner, but other than that I still had a lovely stay.",

The hotel is located in the heart of the best shopping and dining in the city, but despite the bustling location, our three rooms were dead quiet for sleeping. The staff really set the place apart from other hotels as well. We had a family member fall ill upon arrival, and the staff were super kind getting him into a room to rest as soon as possible, and even helping us with a special request for chicken soup at an odd hour. The breakfast included was expansive, and the host took time to not only walk me through the entire selection, but also point out, item by item, what would work for my dietary restrictions. After our departure, the hotel alerted us immediately when cleaning staff discovered my family member had left valuables in the safe, and kept them secure for us until we could retrieve a week later.

The mains were a little bit overpriced for what they were especially the schnitzel at nearly \u00a316 and came with a few chips. I was going to order the curry but I seen it was \u00a317 which is unbelievable for chicken curry and rice!! The desserts were really nice though. I wouldn't come here again as I don't believe it's good value for your money. We came as a group of 6 but for my partner an myself our food came to \u00a380.

Side of cauliflower cheese and stuffing:Dinners: it was delicious, every bite. Nothing was done incorrectly. The meat was soft and tender, the beef was cooked perfectly. The roast potato's crunchy, the veg lovely, Yorkshire pudding was airy a good size, stuffing with bacon wrapped around them were delicious.You get a small pot of gravy, which was plenty. We did ask for more, and it came instantly. Mint sauce tasted home made, which I didn't expect.A weirdly odd thing which I loved how was the veg came in a separate dish on the plate, so you could share with someone or chose what you wanted from the fish. I feel this place nailed everything!And for the price, you couldn't ask for me. We paid \u00a354; 2 dinners, 2 sides, and 2 drinks. And considering the size and quality, I would easily pay that again and again.Service:Polite staff, who all looked incredibly professional. We never waited long for anything, that includes our dinners. We were never rushed and felt we ordered at our own pace.Atmosphere:Absolutely gorgeous, from the low beam ceiling, to the firepits placed around. There was a lovely couple with a baby in a high seat, and I felt the atmosphere was so relaxed and call.Bravo to the staff, chefs and owner for making an incredibly venue.Dietary restrictions: We was asked before any ordering took place whether there were any dietary requirementsParking: They have onsite parking, it was quite busy but didn't struggle.Kid-friendliness: The atmosphere was perfect for young children and pets, brilliant overall.",

When she served the burger, she had made sure that the dressing, coleslaw and onion rings (as my wife had them) were served separately as the dressing had tomato in it and the coleslaw had raw onion in it, l hadn't asked for this, Alexandra took it upon herself to arrange my burger like this and thought this was amazing service.

We were served by Nabi, who was very helpful and lovely to us. I confirmed with him that everything (all foods) on the buffet menu is halal, and also noticed a physical copy of the halal certification at the buffet station.I come from Singapore, where I have had my fair share of consuming Indian cuisine (either Indian-Muslim food or authentic vegetarian Indian buffets that my Indian friends recommend), and I would say some dishes like palak paneer and dal bhaji are comparable to those served back at my home. The flavors are not as intense and still really enjoyable, while the meats they serve are tender as well. I'm a huge chicken fan and because of my dietary restriction, it's difficult to find chicken dishes to enjoy around here so I might be biased but I strongly recommend the Tandoori chicken and Curry chicken!Service-wise, Nabi did an excellent job in making sure we had a great dining experience and was so kind to us. Just as we were about to leave, he provided us with a coupon for 20% off for weekday buffets. I really appreciate the hospitality we received there, especially from Nabi. Although Sitar was quite far and not so accessible for us without a car, we might have to visit them again!Vegetarian options: Majority of the dishes were vegetarian, and vegan-friendly.Dietary restrictions: All meats served during the buffet are halal certified, for which their halal certification is up in the restaurant.",

The chefs are quick to serve food and they execute it to perfection. The food presentation is amazing and food taste is so good I cannot find appropriate words to describe it. Separate components of the dish and they altogether sing perfectly in the mouth. The place is lovely and I enjoyed watching birds.Dietary restrictions: I requested pescaterian food without alcohol and I got it. It was as good as the alternative, I think!",

L\u2019atmosfera \u00e8 distesa, serena e conviviale, merito del grande tessuto di habitu\u00e9 che, nonostante la sua recente apertura, popolano il locale, rendendolo un po\u2019 salotto, un po\u2019 ufficio, un po\u2019 casa.Il dehor sul retro regala una piccola fuga dalla realt\u00e0 frenetica di ogni giornata, permettendo a chiunque vi acceda un momento di pace in cui degustare il miglior cappuccino della provincia: lucido, cremoso e senza bolle. Il suo accompagnamento naturale sono i bign\u00e8 freschissimi o, per i pi\u00f9 attenti alla linea, il mitico banana bread della Lodo, regina indiscussa del locale.Menzione d\u2019onore alla selezione musicale: dal grande pop in chiave bossa nova, alla musica d\u2019atmosfera, ai classiconi della musica nostrana. Che sia l\u00ec per una colazione, per un pranzo o per un aperitivo, Massimo avr\u00e0 sempre la chiave sonora perfetta per te.5 stelle!",

The pulpo was really delicious and I\u2019d order this again.Dietary restrictions: They were accommodating to dietary restrictions: lactose, gluten and garlicThey unfortunately didn\u2019t have gluten free bread.",

The waitress was very polite, friendly and helpful and she even let us sample a couple of wines before we committed to buying a glass.I ordered a tuna steak with a parsnip pur\u00e9e and It was the best tuna steak I've ever eaten! Cooked to perfection. My partner ordered the duck. He said it was ever-so-slightly overcooked, but was delicious regardless!It is a little on the pricier side, but I'd say it was worth every Euro.If we ever visit Dubrovnik again, we will be coming back here.

Both were lovely but I did struggle to finish mine. It was a generous portion compared to the duck but was too rich for me to finish. The duck was missing something I thought, it was just the bed of mascarpone polenta and 2 sttips of duck breast, no veg.The dessert was the highlight, an almond cake, named \"traditional dubrovnik\" which was fresh and light and cakes and lovely.All in all a very nice restaurant but steep prices compared to other options.",
