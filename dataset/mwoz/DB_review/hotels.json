The bus stop was right outside the front door, tram station a block or so away, and not too far of a walk to a few train stations. There were several grocery stores and restaurants nearby for food. I would recommend Cityroomz to any budget traveler if the price is right, it was a solid room that we felt safe to stay in.Pros:- Kettle in room with tea satchets- Clean bedding- Hot showers, full bathtub, and good water pressure (best we had for 3 different hotels in Scotland)- Easy and accessible locationCons:- Bathroom needed a deep clean - shower corners showed grime, plastic on door was dirty- House cleaning did not come most of the days we were there - meaning no clean cups or towels- Water in bathroom got very hot - not safe for small children- Elevator was VERY slow. There was also times when housekeeping would hold it up and you could wait 10 minutes for it- Odd layout - I get it's an old building, but it was hard to navigate around to come and go- Old Building - Room showed it was an old building with hastily repaired cracks in the ceilings and wallsRooms: Older rooms that have been repaired and show age of building. Fairly clean but bathroom needed deep clean. Pretty quiet - we could not hear our neighbors. Disappointed to find no privacy curtains (sheer) just blackout curtains for a window that faced a courtyard of 3 other buildings.Nearby activities: Shopping in New Town, Royal mile is 10min walk, cathedrals and gardens nearby.Safety: We felt very safe in the building and surrounding area. The front desk is manned 24/7 and you need a keycard to access the elevators/stairs.Walkability: Very easy to access public transportation, shopping, and sightseeing from this location.Food and drinks: This hotel only provides tea/coffee and a kettle.",

Free parking is very helpful - just remember to log your car registration at Reception. Only downside was the food in restaurant - it is not great, trying to find a healthy option was pretty impossible.

After a few days, Appy and Patrick had our family at a first name basis. They welcomed us warmly and made us feel like family! Appy and Patrick went above and beyond with everything. We ate in the hotel every night with our family of 5 and they were helpful and accommodating. It made us smile every night we saw them and kept bringing us back.Sushi (unsure how to spell her name) was wonderful - I had conversations with her multiple times. She helped in the kitchen at breakfast and a few times at dinner. I appreciated her hard work as she held down the job and defended her dissertation at university! I know she\u2019s a hard worker - I watched her do a late evening shift and then do a breakfast shift the following day. She brought out small things to entertain our kids at meals, so thoughtful.Candace was wonderful! Bright smile and helped recommend some great local playgrounds for the kids.One thing I wish they would improve as a system - they had water coolers in a few locations for the hotel to use and glasses to grab. But after grabbing a glass that still had someone else\u2019s lipstick on it - I never wanted to use it again. Not sure if they need to clean the glasses better, or have a better way for people to put away dirty glasses.The room felt a little small for a family of five. The kids were on a pullout that had a very thin mattress. The other mattress was also hard to sleep on.Nearby activities: 30 min walk to playgrounds.Walkability: Easy to get to some main roads. Walking path nearby.Food & drinks: Included breakfast every morning. Lunch, drinks and dinner available at restaurant on site.",

The first time was significantly more enjoyable experience.Firstly I will say the hotel is very good value for money and is located in a great location.On our recent visit, we were put in a room which neither of the charging ports next to our bed worked, we were only given 1 bath towel for 2 guests and were still not given an extra one upon requesting it with the staff. The rooms were cleaned daily and still we weren't given an extra towel at any point.On this visit the hotel was extremely busy which of course is normal for a bank holiday/half term.However this does show up the limitations of the hotel with the breakfast area being very small and narrow. Also we took our dog with us and the seating is more limited for those who choose to take their pets, which is fine but it was almost permanently full at breakfast mostly by people who don't have pets with them.Maybe the section needs reserving for people with animals if you're going to separate them?The breakfast options are fine for what you're paying, however I will say the coffee from the machine in the breakfast area is awful. Genuinely one of the worst I've ever had.Overall the hotel is nice and especially considering it's price point. I would say it could do with an extra bit of care and attention but I would stay here again.",

This is only a very minor thing though and pillows are such a personal thing it's difficult for any hotel to give you what you spent years being used to at home.The included breakfast was very nice and there was a good selection.The staff were all very nice and friendly.We came here for the weekend and thought it was in a good location. Very easy to walk to all the tourist sites and the punting.It's not all that obvious but they offer a FREE 45 minute tour in one of their Bentley's which made us feel very special.We went in the 1953 Bentley which was really nice and we felt very special and the chauffeur was very knowledgeable. This went round local villages and then dropped us off for a private punting tour which the hotel arranged for us (punting was obviously at a price) but it was well worth it.The hotel also has a handful of free bikes you can use. We planned to do that but found everywhere seemed a little busy so found it better to walk.All in all a great weekend and if we go back to Cambridge we would definitely consider staying here again.Noteworthy details: Free Bentley tour and bikes",

Would have been even better if each room had a mini fridge, but the ice machine makes up for this somewhat.The only thing that I didn't love and felt that the staff was not able to adequately explain was why my friend was charged a \u00a350 deposit on arrival. We were staying for a wedding, with lots of other guests with the same hotel booking as ours, but none of them were charged a deposit whatsoever. When my friend questioned it, the staff member said it's standard and on the website, and usually charged for the number of nights you stay (we were only charged for one night). However, we highlighted that there was zero information about a deposit in any of the Delta Marriott emails related to our booking (we combed every one of them). I don't think it's acceptable to say \"it's on the website\" when you haven't specified it in the booking journey or in any booking emails. Nor is it acceptable to charge a deposit for one night if you're actually supposed to book every night of the stay - it defeats the point of applying the supposed rule. Our suspicion is that the deposit was charged opportunistically because my friend checked in slightly tipsy; I was elsewhere during the check-in process and sober, so I wonder if I had been there if it would have been a different story. It doesn't stack up that no one else in our wedding party were charged deposits like our room was. I have no problem paying a deposit, but Delta Marriott should state the reason for this and in both the booking journey and booking emails. It's disingenuous and misleading, particularly when staff had nothing to respond with when we pointed out no one else from our party had been charged.Other than that, I'd love to return and found it to be a great experience.Rooms: Spacious, comfortable, clean. I found it frustrating that I couldn't have a UK three-pin plug to charge my devices at the side of the bed. I had to charge these at the desk - not the end of the world, but not convenient.Safety: I felt very safe inside the hotel as well as standing outside out front (day and night)Walkability: You need a car or taxi to access the hotel",

Firstly, it was surprisingly easy to find using City Mapper - it is pretty much a straight line, 10 mins from Maidstone East station, with a pleasant walk through the high street - you will be able to get acclimated with the area on the walk there. I was provided with an entry code to the front door which takes you into a beautifully adorned sitting room. You are asked to take your shoes off, and the moment you step foot in the place, you will feel glad you honoured that request - the place is beautiful, recently renovated with a number of grand sitting areas, keeping true to the period design of the property. The idea is that you go straight to your room, where you will find your room keys and everything you need for your stay there. I, however, got a little confused and was greeted by the proprietor Saban, who enthusiastically gave me the \u2018Grand Tour\u2019 before showing me to my room. The place is incredible, do take the opportunity to have a look around - it is welcomed! It is also far bigger than you would expect from the outside.My initial room was gorgeous - sizeable double bed, freestanding bath with grand period furniture - however, my eyes were turned by another room, with a four poster bed and Saban generously offered me an upgrade at no expense. The pictures are of that room - they paint the proverbial 1000 words I could write.Facilities are beyond what you would expect from a property of this type. The rooms are soundproof and you are provided with all the amenities of a high-end hotel - TV, Wifi, bath robes, tea, extra towels etc. - everything you need for a comfortable stay.The place is as clean as The Dorchester with similar attention to detail in the overall design - what they have accomplished with the renovations is nothing short of startling. The bed was large, the sheets were silky, places to sit and work (if on business).Saban and Belinda are wonderful hosts and could not have been more welcoming or hospitable - they are clearly proud of what they have built here and all I can really say is that they should be - I was told about the future plans for the place, and I have no doubt that it will be even better when I visit next.If you want to have a place just outside of the hustle and bustle of London (with the accompanying price tag) but less than an hour away with a quintessential British Market town as your backdrop, this really is the only choice I could recommend.The room I had, in London, would have been 10x the price for what I got here - and this is no exaggeration, you can read my other reviews - it cannot possibly stay with such unbelievable value, as word gets out and demand increases, so I would get in now while you can and enjoy a place of this quality for the price of a Premier Inn - please don\u2019t let the price fool you, this is an excellent property that would be great value at twice the price.Finally, I didn\u2019t get to say goodbye to my lovely hosts, but I look forward to seeing them again and hope this honest review makes up for it. Until next time.Rooms: Romantic, period design, large, well adorned, excellent facilities - astonishing price.",

My bedside cabinet had a haribo sweet and empty chocolate wrapper in it.I can't fault the service of the staff and the massage my friend and I had was lovely.The spa facilities are also very nice.My friend and I are going to try somewhere else next year.Food and drinks: My friend and I fancied a cocktail before our dinner. I ordered a Cosmopolitan, and my friend ordered a Mohito.  We wished we hadn't ordered them. When they were poured out, they were bought in premade out of a bottle. Poured into a measurer, put in a shaker with ice and poured in a glass. Mine had an orange slice, and my friend had a sprig of past its best mint.  \u00a324 for 2 knock-off cocktails really isn't on.  We definitely felt ripped off.The dinner menu wasn't as nice as the autumn menu.  I'm not sure if this is because there is a different chef.  But again, \u00a319.99 for a cheese burger and fries was expensive for what it was.",

The hygiene and cleanliness was decent however, the toilets are not always monitored as the toilets started to become untidy. Besides, the celebration event went amazing as my mum had a great time. The location is decent as you have a Morrisons and a home bargains, however, for the town centre you have to travel to get there either by park and ride which I recommend or a stagecoach bus but that will be 19 stops long which I do not recommend. In conclusion, it is a nice hotel with a beautiful scenery of the outskirts countryside of Cambridge along with a lake on the outside of the hotel.",

The table for breads and toast has no plates on it. All plates and dishes are stacked up on a different table at corner by the fruit bowls. I said why don't they have plates by the bread? There is plenty of space. One of waitresses said she'd mention it to the manager.It is a shame, since was expecting a positive and relaxed experience - and their all-in breakfast does not come cheap at \u00a325 plus 10% service charge, but I am left dissatisfied.
