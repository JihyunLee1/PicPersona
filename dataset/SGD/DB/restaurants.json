This is always a good sign.Upon receiving my food I was once again captured by the aroma. This time it was the aromas of General Tso Chicken and a fresh out of the grease Pork Egg Roll!! Oh yeah\u2026 Let\u2019s Eat!!!Upon opening my tray the visual alone let me know this was going to be a good eat. LoL.The General Tso Chicken was perfectly made. Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The sauce has a perfect level of spice with a hint of sweet. I\u2019m talking goooooooddddddddd. Truly a 10 out of 10.The Pork Fried Rice wasn\u2019t dry, had the perfect  golden fried color and tender meaty chunks of pork.The Pork Egg Roll was packed full of fresh fixings and fried to golden egg roll perfection.I truly enjoyed my Golden Wok experience. If you\u2019re in the area and looking for something with great quality, great flavors, and filling\u2026 You must stop in.",

This was my first Thai food experience and we decided to go during Houston Restaurant Weeks.  For my first course I had the CHICKEN SATAY KABOBS which were chicken skewers served with peanut sauce.  My wife had Lobster and goat cheese stuffed dumplings, garnished with avocados and topped with pineapple curry sauce. For the second course I had PAD MED MAMMUANG (STIR-FRY CASHEWS) which were Hoisen based sauce saut\u00e9ed with mushrooms, onions, snow peas, water chestnuts and cashews.  My wife had KANG KARI (YELLOW CURRY) which is Thai yellow curry with curry powder, potatoes, onions and cashews, with a hint of cumin, turmeric and cinnamon.  My dessert was Coconut sweet sticky rice topped with fresh chopped strawberries.  My wife had Cheesecake topped with mango puree.  We also shared a bottle of Nine Hats Red Blend.  I had asked the server to bring out extra spice on the side.  The food was delicious.  I did add some of the spice to the stir fry cashew and it really added some heat.  The restaurant was very busy and the wait staff was clearly over worked.  Michael was extremely friendly however we did have to wait a fairly lengthy amount of time for our first course and again for our check.  I did not mark down for this since it was clearly not the server's fault, however I mention it because customers should adjust their expectations if there is a crowd, at least until the restaurant can adjust its number of staff.

It's the same sauce for everything.They cook all the meat on one side of the grill and the rest of the food on another grill. The sushi is made in the kitchen/behind the cashier.Depending on when you get your food, you may need to wait a while (~20 mins) until they cook a batch of chicken - even though you may spot some cooked chicken on standby to be placed on a tray.The waiting line is like an assembly line - you order & pay and roughly follow your tray on the bar holder above the grill. They may or may not call your order # so I think it's better to roughly guess which tray is yours and follow it.",

The waiter was amazing (I wish I could remember his name)[fair-skinned black guy around late 30s to early 40s], and he was extremely polite and attentive. I can honestly say that he is one of the best servers I've come across in a restaurant chain. He was even engaging with our 6 month old son and making him smile. That alone is an attribute that not many other servers possess. He made sure to come around multiple times to check on us and was on top of drink refills. His positive attitude stayed consistent throughout our entire time here, which made us feel very welcome.Now, the cons of this particular location;-The men's bathroom was pretty gross and had a very strong urine odor upon entry.-The tables were not thoroughly cleaned and specks of food were still clearly visible-The booster seat for our son was very unsecure, and we had to prop him in place and keep a hold of him to ensure he did not have a chance of falling-The jalapeno cheddar smoked sausage could have used more seasoning and it lacked smoke flavorOverall, the experience was decent, but the waiter made it memorable.

The attendant in the breakfast area was very helpful and nice.  Beds are obviously old. Both beds leaned down at the head end and we had to prop it up with pillows under the mattress so we didn't feel like the blood was running to our heads. The AC ran all night and hardly cooled the room. Every time it cycled off there was a boom that woke me up several times during the night.The price quoted on their website was really off of what I was charged. I looked at the final bill and found that there is a \" Service Fee\" of 28%.  So, the rate of $199.00 sounded acceptable for a no frills room (2 queen beds with no extras) until they added a \"service fee\" of $31.84, and the Occupancy Tax of $23.88. So the rate of $199. turned into $254.72. I don't know what a \"Service fee\" includes, but had I known of the final total I would not have selected this hotel unless all of the hotels in this area have a similar 28% \"Service Fee\".  Probably going to use the mattress in the van more often:)The view was great, and the restaurant was really good with fair prices.

There was a line out the door on a Thursday at lunchtime, but only one waitress handling phone orders, take outs, and eat-ins (outdoor on the sidewalk).  I had ordered pick up through DD, but still had to wait for almost 10 minutes while my completed order sat on the back counter; the waitress was busy on the phone taking an order.2/19/21 Update:  Friday lunch today.  There was zero wait time with two waitresses.  Two item bento (sashimi x 3, nigiri x 2) isn\u2019t quite enough - I had to make some miso soup at home to compensate.  Next time, I\u2019ll go for the 3 item bento or the bento special.3/3/21 Update:  They removed the ringer at the front counter, so I had to wave down the waitress.  Luckily, I was in and out in 2 minutes.  Assorted sashimi lunch 12p for $18.95 is a good value/upgrade from large Poke Bowl for $15 elsewhere.  The slices were smaller and one grade down from the chirashi special, but still excellent and well worth it.  This may become my standard go-to order at Meiko.3/5/21 Update:  Chirashi Regular was excellent!  A good value at $22 for the quality.  The Chirashi Special had better slices for $25, but the Regular was fine, nonetheless.  Both Chirashi were a step up from the regular sashimi- plus you get vinegar rice and the tamago.  I was in and out in 30 seconds on this Friday (two waitresses).  I think the high turnover at Meiko ensures that you get fresh sashimi.7/16/21 Update:  I have ordered the regular Chirashi Sushi two more times.  The first time, I noticed a drop in quality in the sashimi/cuts and much heavier tasting rice.  Not sure if the drop in quality was a fluke, I waited a couple weeks and then ordered again.  Unfortunately, the same consistent drop in quality.  Tastes like they changed chefs.  Service is still fast and friendly.  Dropping one star to 4.",

We were delighted to see many restaurant choices and many Indian markets! The only problem we then have is which one should we choose to eat at? Simple: choose the one that is full of people. PBC Factory was just that. After eating there we noticed a few things that set it apart from other restaurants similar to it. The prices are generally lower, the quality is just as high, and they have digital systems in place that make it very easy to order. This is great for people on the go. Everything we ordered was vegan and the Chef personally served us and walked us through the options. A+ customer service! We had (my favorite Indian dish) Gobi Manchurian , Samosa Chaat, and Masala Dosa. I noticed that chef utilizes citrus more than other Indian restaurants we\u2019ve eaten at. I love that. The lemony touch is an incredible addition. Well done chef. Next time we are in Tampa we will definitely visit \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",

No sooner did I find the page for this restaurant, \"Tabla Fine Indian Cuisine\".Looking through there menu, my appetite grew. I not only orders a side of vegetable pakoras and garlic naan, I also ordered a DELICIOUS lamb rogan josh, and to wash it all down, a classic mango lassi.I ordered around 6:45, and my food came at about 7:20, not too bad for delivery. The food did get a bit cold on arrival, but I did reheat my food. Let's start: I was craving onion pakoras, but there were simply \"pakoras\" on the app, so I assume its a veggie-medley pakora. It is strong on squash/pumpkin if you like that flavor...I'd give that a 4/5. Delicious, but that squash is filling!The LAMB ROGAN JOSH was something I was looking forward to, because I've seen many people order it and say it's amazing. I loved it! Only downside? I wanted more meat! There was a lot of sauce to clean-up with the garlic naan, but I was done with meat (+rice) REAL QUICK. I think it's part appetite, but also part inflation. Whatever the reason it was gone too soon!Lastly, I got the mango lassi. I put it in the fridge to get cold again. What can I say? It's a wonderful fruity, smooth drink that washes all the spicy food down and gives me a fresh palette. There mango lassi has a slight hint of cardamum, fyi.Besides the meat issue and pumpkin-heavy pakoras, this place was a gem! 4/5! Would recommend!!",

Sake was a bit more price-wise than I expected but as the rest of the food, it was a great brand (Nigeria Sake) Last but not least, the service from one of the girls on the till was beyond any service I have ever had in all of Vilnius.

I\u2019m definitely not impressed by the taste profile of any of the food items.Our server was very attentive, with her constantly keeping the table clean of food debris, but another server who brought the dessert literally made my jaw drop for the wrong reason. He simply pour the syrup onto/into the souffl\u00e9 without checking with us. It made the dessert too sweet to be enjoyed. That was not a good move. He basically brought it to the table and went about carrying out his act without 1st checking with us. I believe he did that thinking it is a show and him providing service but I definitely did not enjoy it. Also, instead of doing that, he could and should at least check and not served melted ice cream to us.We did come during dinner time, and I am usually not very particular about the ambience of restaurant but it is particularly dimly lit at this place that I could barely see what I\u2019m really eating.

The lobster bisque was sweet and savory with small chunks of lobster. Honestly, the bisque at another well known, new steakhouse in San Jose gives a lot more lobster. The beet salad was very nice and refreshing.But the reason for the five stars were the main courses. Perfectly prepared dry aged porterhouse and new york steaks melted in your mouth, yet had just enough texture. The mero sea bass was a large serving, flaky, soft, and delicious.

It's the same sauce for everything.They cook all the meat on one side of the grill and the rest of the food on another grill. The sushi is made in the kitchen/behind the cashier.Depending on when you get your food, you may need to wait a while (~20 mins) until they cook a batch of chicken - even though you may spot some cooked chicken on standby to be placed on a tray.The waiting line is like an assembly line - you order & pay and roughly follow your tray on the bar holder above the grill. They may or may not call your order # so I think it's better to roughly guess which tray is yours and follow it.",

Try laying them like a lean-to.Lava cake and Gelato that tastes like ice cream is to die for.  Only noteworthy dessert item by far.Will be back.Parking: In back off the alley.  Back door sticks",

From the attentive wait staff to the delicious appetizer and entree, this place is a Chico treasure. My filet was cooked perfectly and was so soft and delicious, I never wanted it to be finished.

Finally getting the chance to dine there, I approached it with an open mind, aware of the mixed reviews it had garnered. As a long-time aficionado of Indian chaat, I was eager to see how this place measured up to my expectations.Our group arrived with an appetite for authentic Indian street food. We ordered a variety of dishes, including samosa chaat, mango lassis, pani puri (also known as gol gappi), and pav bhaji. The samosa chaat was the star of the meal, earning a well-deserved perfect 10 rating. It hit all the right notes, balancing flavors and textures expertly.The mango lassis were a delightful respite from the spice, offering a sweet and refreshing counterbalance. They were consumed quickly and were a highlight of the meal.However, the pani puri presented a challenge. It skewed heavily towards the spicy side, overwhelming my palate and that of my group. While spice is a staple of Indian cuisine, this was a notch above our comfort level. Unfortunately, the pav bhaji was a letdown. The bhaji lacked the freshness I anticipated, tasting somewhat stale, and the bread served with it was regular sandwich bread instead of the traditional pav. This deviation from authenticity was a noticeable drawback.In terms of service, Chaat Corner performed admirably. We were seated promptly, and our orders were served quickly, a testament to the efficiency of the staff.Parking: There is a large underground parking lot right next to the restaurant.",

Yesterday was my son\u2019s first birthday and his mother and I had planned an elaborate day for him that included many sights and stops. You could even say over planned for a one year old. But we hadn\u2019t planned anything for family and friends to get together and celebrate with him. We called the Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s reservation line the day of his birthday hoping to schedule a party for that night, but they informed us that it was absolutely nothing they could do to help make my son\u2019s big day special because we needed to had called at least a day before to set up a reservation. So me, naturally not giving up in the face of adversity, stopped by the Gulfgate location early in the day where I spoke with the on duty manager, Giselle and explained my dilemma. She was so sweet and understanding, and although she could not create a reservation, she insisted that she could find a way to help make his day special in her location. When I returned later that night to celebrate with my son Giselle had kept her word, she had went above and beyond to give us an amazing customer experience. She set up our table decorations herself, put birthday crowns and cups together, put party cards on the kids wrists, and ultimately gave us the complete gift of feeling welcomed and appreciated as people. We had so much fun and enjoyed every moment. From the food to the games to service. Everything was amazing and Giselle helped to make a special day even more memorable. Thank you!",

The waitress did a great job suggesting us to have the italian dressing for the salad, that they make in house. After placing the order i requested the waitress to change a side. Stuffed baked potato instead of mashed potatoes. I thought she would say no or its too late but guess what she said yes n served both. Checked on us a few times.The steaks were pretty decent according to the price. For the rib eye, my partner asked sauted mushrooms n onions toppings. And it was the best decision. It was juicy as hell. The t-bone seemed a bit dry for me but its fine cz its solid meat. Pairing it with mashed potatoes gives a kick. But i expected a greater quantity of my mushroom side.

Ordered medium rare steak, it came rare. Seasoning of the six ounce sirloin just seemed off like it was missing something. The steam vegetables also didn\u2019t seem to be good quality or cooked quite enough. Also my chili cup was a bit spicy even though I was told it wasn\u2019t. The server didn\u2019t come by much to check on us, so it wasn\u2019t til I was almost done that she stopped by and offered some more cheese and sour cream to help me chill down the spice. At that point I had only two spoonfuls left. My friend seemed to enjoy his beef tips with onion dish and his fries were well seasoned (not overly done like some places). Their fresh rolls were good as always with the cinnamon butter but would\u2019ve loved anorher basket much sooner.

The staff is super friendly, and working their tails off, but are obviously swamped - we were there for nearly an hour and a half, but were never offered refills (even of water), and we had long waits between arriving, ordering, food delivery, and getting our bill. The atmosphere is fantastic, and you can tell that for many of the diners this is their regular stop.For the food, we admittedly went a little basic and just ordered the enchiladas, one with ranchero sauce and one with verde. We got the expected chips and salsa, which were very good. The main dishes were a mixed bag. The ranchero sauce is obviously meant for... \"uncomplicated\" palates, being sweet and otherwise pretty flavorless. The verde sauce, on the other hand, was fabulous, letting the tomatillos be the star rather than bombarding the sauce with jalapenos like so many other places do.Overall, give this place a try. Obviously, there are many people who love it, and we could have just been there on a night with staffing troubles. At worst, you'll have had an OK meal at a fair price at a pace that forces you to relax. But definitely skip anything with the ranchero sauce.",

It's the same sauce for everything.They cook all the meat on one side of the grill and the rest of the food on another grill. The sushi is made in the kitchen/behind the cashier.Depending on when you get your food, you may need to wait a while (~20 mins) until they cook a batch of chicken - even though you may spot some cooked chicken on standby to be placed on a tray.The waiting line is like an assembly line - you order & pay and roughly follow your tray on the bar holder above the grill. They may or may not call your order # so I think it's better to roughly guess which tray is yours and follow it.",

It's the same sauce for everything.They cook all the meat on one side of the grill and the rest of the food on another grill. The sushi is made in the kitchen/behind the cashier.Depending on when you get your food, you may need to wait a while (~20 mins) until they cook a batch of chicken - even though you may spot some cooked chicken on standby to be placed on a tray.The waiting line is like an assembly line - you order & pay and roughly follow your tray on the bar holder above the grill. They may or may not call your order # so I think it's better to roughly guess which tray is yours and follow it.",

It's the same sauce for everything.They cook all the meat on one side of the grill and the rest of the food on another grill. The sushi is made in the kitchen/behind the cashier.Depending on when you get your food, you may need to wait a while (~20 mins) until they cook a batch of chicken - even though you may spot some cooked chicken on standby to be placed on a tray.The waiting line is like an assembly line - you order & pay and roughly follow your tray on the bar holder above the grill. They may or may not call your order # so I think it's better to roughly guess which tray is yours and follow it.",

Over the months during the pandemic, I noticed a regression in the taste of the grilled chicken. Hey, there was a time when one had to wait in line here! Ok? The 'straw that broke the camel's back' for me happened when a lady who's usually on the register, in now on the grill! True, she gave good portions but I don't think the chicken she was grilling...was ready for consumption though she gestured, mines was ready. I ate my grilled chicken plate which brought about a tummy ache. Haven't been back since and that was approximately a couple of years ago. It's interesting, Panda Express hasn't upset my stomach yet.

This is just not reasonable for us, and so we have had to take our sushi loving selves elsewhere this trip.  I hope they can cut their prices so that we can enjoy them in the future but if not we will not be back unfortunately.Original review 4 years ago: The best sushi I have ever eaten. I thought that I knew sushi, but this put every other experience to shame! Kabuto sushi has only been open for two days, and I can already tell they are going to be very successful. Our server Hunter was very attentive and caring, and all of the staff were happy and friendly. The presentation of the sushi was far above anything I have experienced. Everything tasted so fresh, and you could really taste every ingredient and the flavors combined to be so delicious! My only complaint is that I live five hours away and have nothing nearby that comes close to what I just experienced!",

                "review_text": "Update 2 (8/2024)- New ownership. We haven't been yet but prices have jumped up and coincidentally enough on the most popular dishes. Both our favorite sushi rolls are over $20 each and it's just not worth it to order here. $12-15 a roll, maybe a tad higher for a good sushi roll... but $20 a roll for sushi in the desert? Better off going to Vegas and getting much better options for lower prices. Sad to type this up as we love the rolls but it just isn't worth that much to us. Review bumped from 5 to 4 stars for affordability and overall value. Food is definitely good but comes at a very high cost.UPDATE (1/2022)- The hours of the restaurant seem to fluctuate, and sometimes they close early or won't allow take-out. Reaching them via phone can be difficult as well too, so just a heads up!BUT.....It's great sushi. One of the best in town. It's a newer restaurant in but has made some waves already for its unique and high quality food.Updated Visit - 8/20 - The Love Me Tender roll is insanely good. I had to get it twice to really appreciate all of the flavors and the complexity of the roll. There is so much going on in the roll (and that it is baked), but wow! This is their best roll IMO.Also try the Garlic Edamame - TASTY! A recent favorite roll as well is the Volcano, so good! My wife's favorite is the Put Your Hand Up roll. It's a good roll, not too fishy, but still sushi and flavorful.Previous Visit - We ordered dinner to-go and got a mix of 4 sushi rolls and a short rib to try a few things on the menu. Unfortunately the short rib meal was not included in our to-go bag, so we'll have to try that again soon. After calling in, the owner was great to make it right and we'll be trying it soon.The sushi rolls we ordered were the Linda, No Pain No Gain, Jackpot, and a California. All of the rolls brought their own uniqueness to the table but there wasn't one roll that really stood out. I would recommend both the No Pain and the Jackpot. The No Pain is a more creative roll with stuffed ingredients and also a mixed ingredient on top. It's labeled as spicy but was mild, in Mt opinion. The sauce was excellent. The Jackpot was a great middle-of-the-road roll. Not too much fish, great presentation, but also a really tasty roll. I'd recommend this roll for someone who likes a more neutral sushi roll and who wants a great flavor as well. This would definitely be a great roll for a beginner to try out.All in all, we were impressed with the presentation of the sushi as well as the quality. They were definitely busy and have some things to work out on the customer service and restaurant management side of things, but they are still learning the ropes so I can't hold that against them, but do expect longer waiting and prep times in the upcoming weeks of their opening in town. We will definitely be back as the menu is quite extensive!",

When cooked for a long time, it should be soft like butter and it should melt in your mouth. This prime rib was a major HIT. Wow. Don\u2019t miss this.I will definitely be back for more Prime Rib. Wow.2024Came back. Still good. They updated their menu too. They have shrimp now and onion rings now. Great food. They open till 12 every day now.Highly recommended",

The owner  was cooking on the grill and he was not having a good day...at all. He seemed to pass the blame on the two kind neighbors/friends that came to rescue him and help him run the diner. The place was full of hungry people and food options were low. I'm not sure what happened prior to us arriving but we should have left. This diner is known for smoked meats and rubs. I didn't realize until later that it was showcases on Guy Fieri Food Network show. I'm not trying to slam the place ...It smelled delicious but the food lacked salt. We both ended up having the smoked chicken. The portion was enough for two but the flavor was lacking. We dis buy a delicious peanut butter chocolate brownie. It was amazing. We bought two. Matt the owner apologized for the fiasco and offered at 20% coupon for our next visit. I'm from LA and probably won't be back anytime soon. Best of luck to ya Matt. Great job to Bob and the cute young waitress for helping you out. They kept a positive attitude in spite of the calamity.",

Only one cook and one waitress which was a bit slow for the holiday. The lunch menu is mainly sandwiches and BBQ around $15-20 per plate. The 10 hour pulled pork sandwich was decent. Our friends liked the brisket. The water tasted terrible, I think it's stored in a metal container. I couldn't drink it. Overall a decent experience but wouldn't recommend or go back. If you have time, go to Gott's or the Sonoma square instead!",

It's the same sauce for everything.They cook all the meat on one side of the grill and the rest of the food on another grill. The sushi is made in the kitchen/behind the cashier.Depending on when you get your food, you may need to wait a while (~20 mins) until they cook a batch of chicken - even though you may spot some cooked chicken on standby to be placed on a tray.The waiting line is like an assembly line - you order & pay and roughly follow your tray on the bar holder above the grill. They may or may not call your order # so I think it's better to roughly guess which tray is yours and follow it.",

I took my leftovers home and am enjoying them now as I write this review. I couldn't recommend this place any more highly.  The chilled summer borscht particularly hits the spot for me. It makes gazpacho (which I like) seem weak and pathetic. My Mom ordered a Lithuanian beer and said it was delicious, she liked it enough to make note of the brand so she could acquire more. My only problem or issue was the chairs, they're heavy and over built and I kept banging my legs into them. Could be a tall person issue. The staff was really friendly and welcoming.  They answered all my dumb questions about the food and the country and seemed pleased to do so. Really, everything about this place was great. I don't live in Alameda, but I'll still be coming back. It's worth the drive for food, service, and atmosphere as fantastic as Mama Papa has. 11/10",

Like eating really good fried chicken without the bones. Great flavors too. Wing sauces are a bit confusing and really not a lot of help based on their on line ordering. Some of the crew would stop by and ask if we needed anything, but others really didn\u2019t do much or were down right rude. The beers were ok. Good enough to wash down the food, but none really stood out enough to recall. Definitely a place to try for the food and maybe the beer rotation will get better",

We like more vinegar with it. We enjoyed the grilled pork with fresh tuna. It was our favorite. The sauce paired well with our crispy pork knuckles and pancit canton. We also had a bangus sisig carry out but its not as yummy as i expected, it was just ok. Might need a little improvement to taste better. Lastly, the superstars of desserts, of course, the shaved iced that's super creamy in halo halo and iced gulaman to beat the summer heat. That super tasty pinipig crunch and ube ice cream was heavenly.. I just wished they put halo halo in a bigger, taller glass like the gulaman. It felt too crammed in a regular drinking glass. But it's still very yummy. Pricing was just right. Our server Lorna was accomodating,  friendly and funny, attentive and courteous.  She even offered us info about the latest happenings, shows and events which is awesome. The Manager, Mr.Dennis was also extraordinary as always. Making guests feel welcome and at home.

It's the same sauce for everything.They cook all the meat on one side of the grill and the rest of the food on another grill. The sushi is made in the kitchen/behind the cashier.Depending on when you get your food, you may need to wait a while (~20 mins) until they cook a batch of chicken - even though you may spot some cooked chicken on standby to be placed on a tray.The waiting line is like an assembly line - you order & pay and roughly follow your tray on the bar holder above the grill. They may or may not call your order # so I think it's better to roughly guess which tray is yours and follow it.",

It's the same sauce for everything.They cook all the meat on one side of the grill and the rest of the food on another grill. The sushi is made in the kitchen/behind the cashier.Depending on when you get your food, you may need to wait a while (~20 mins) until they cook a batch of chicken - even though you may spot some cooked chicken on standby to be placed on a tray.The waiting line is like an assembly line - you order & pay and roughly follow your tray on the bar holder above the grill. They may or may not call your order # so I think it's better to roughly guess which tray is yours and follow it.",

Since I travel very often, I religiously follow google and yelp guidelines when it comes to picking food, places to visit, hotel...first thing that bothered me is extremely common in that area, they do not respect the scheduled hours they dispose online. After a 15-20 minutes detour, I was excised to finally eat, it was 4 pm, I hadn\u2019t even eat lunch because I wanted to try on the menu. I got there and it\u2019s closed from 3pm to 4h30 pm apparently while on google it stated that it was open until 10. I decide to stop by an ice cream place across the street that\u2019s supposedly open according to google, and it\u2019s close as well, same thing with the other Indian restaurant nearby. I finally spot an employee at 4h25 pm and he tells me to come back in 10 min. I get back and place my order. I ask the waiter about the menu preferences and I order 2 appetizers and 1 meal that was around 14$. I get my appetizer and they were good, but that\u2019s it. Not exceptional whatsoever, just basic Indian food. When I get my main plate, I realize that they didn\u2019t give me my order, but a tandoori mixed grill that\u2019s 20.95$. I barely had service and had to aske for water refill. Moral of the story is that service is not that great and food is just borderline ok. Don\u2019t get there with high hopes.",

I do not like cheese and hence I had to tell the server. He was nice and took it and got me the order without cheese. Lessons learned, don't assume and call it out at the beginning itself to be safe. We enjoyed our dinner, the brussel sprouts was delicious and with dry fruits and dried cranberries it tasted awesome. The tiramisu cake was so delicious we both finished it quickly in no time.

Easily one of the best spots in the city to get a creative, well balanced, and exceptional cocktail.This place is a must visit as it will become a regular in our roster for recommendations and visits.",

After we decided on wine, he began to pour in the bottle was almost empty leaving this half a glass short then waited over 30 minutes for him to come back. He never came so we had to ask the waitress and she finally brought the bottle over and poured us, barely a glass.  We honestly not sure if it was the same wine. From this point on the service was even slower and the table was right next to the kitchen, which was loud and hot. In the end, it was not a great experience. We went there because of high publicity and great reviews. I also discovered that the owner was not there that night and probably that is why the service was horrible.  When we are back in Lisbon we will definitely not come back to this restaurant.",

Definitely use the sliced bread to sop up the butter sauce. The Boudin Benedict was really good too. The poached egg was perfectly executed, runny yolks as you cut into it. The crawfish omelet had the right sauce, it was crispy outside and creamy eggy inside.Why the 3 star review? The service and execution. We arrived at 11:15, received our oysters 5 minutes after we ordered then waited over 30 minutes for our entrees. There were people who came at noon that received their food before us. I inquired at 12:15 and they said they will check on it. Found out that they delivered our food to another table that came after us. The manager did come and apologized and offered us each a glass of bubbly. Kudos to management to keep the guests happy. I heard that this is their first few weekends for brunch, but the kitchen and food expediter needs to get their acts together.I'm willing to give them another shot and come back for dinner to try the New Orleans classics, jambalaya and gumbo.

Whole bottle of wine for $18 on Wednesday and he had a blast, my food was incredibly tasty and urgh I just wish I had more.. I tried the salmone and I am not sure if I will be trying anything else. My friend had pollo parmigiana and I will add pictures. I can\u2019t forget to praise the service, I was really happy with my experience. Parking was hard tho, I saw someone walking out so I followed them to get their spot but if it wasn\u2019t for that, no spots on Wednesday night.",

Most everything is light, fresh, and well prepared. The prepared salads are particularly good. Service and staff are friendly.Prices are on the higher side, but Pacific Catch targets more upscale areas. Prices reflect the buying power of the local demographic.On a sunny afternoon, snag a seat in the outside dining area, grab a salad and a glass of wine, and enjoy the Silicon Valley   vibe. Bright, airy, and casual , the venue is a good first date restaurant,in my opinion. The relaxed yet festive atmosphere lends itself to casual conversation, and, perhaps a 2nd date.",

Both the bowls had quite decent portion sizes and the shrimp and tuna tasted absolutely delicious.

It's the same sauce for everything.They cook all the meat on one side of the grill and the rest of the food on another grill. The sushi is made in the kitchen/behind the cashier.Depending on when you get your food, you may need to wait a while (~20 mins) until they cook a batch of chicken - even though you may spot some cooked chicken on standby to be placed on a tray.The waiting line is like an assembly line - you order & pay and roughly follow your tray on the bar holder above the grill. They may or may not call your order # so I think it's better to roughly guess which tray is yours and follow it.",

The deck seating would have been perfectly lovely if not for the yellow jackets everywhere, but to be fair there were traps at regular intervals, so the restaurant is aware and trying to manage it, and I could have chosen to sit inside instead. No issues with that--definitely not their fault, but something to be aware of, especially if you're traveling with kids.The food was fine. Nothing special and very much overpriced for what it was, but it was hot and edible if a little bland, and the fries were actually pretty tasty. Unfortunately, I wouldn't say it was worth having paid $24 for two thin cod fillets.",

All were great, but we all agreed the pan fried noodles were a bit bland.The staff and service were great and the food was served quickly and hot.",

Definitely make reservations as there will be a line!We ordered a bunch of appetizers and main dishes for a group of 9 and had plenty of leftovers. The taste on average is tailored to Americans and less genuine for typical Chinese.  All my white friends LOVE the food though! Our server Benny is FANTASTIC and kept everyone entertained throughout the meal.Appetizers:- Spicy wonton soup: The most popular dish with the crowd in a dark garlic spicy soup that is like a French onion soup.-  Spring rolls: Hot fried rolls with chopped Napa cabbage. Really tasty.- Steamed soup dumplings: basically XLB which is ok. Serve with vinegar.Main dishes:- Slippery shrimp: Apparently a signature dish everyone gets. Cooked in a thick orange/lemon tangy sauce. Feels ok and not super impressive to my Chinese palette.- Kung Pao shrimp: More flavorful version with peanuts and chopped veggies. My preferred way to cook shrimp.- Mongolian beef with scallions:  Good.- Lamb with asparagus: Good.- Veggie fried rice: A bit plain.- Beef Lo Mein: Semi soupy soft noodle. It cooks with pork on the menu but you can substitute for beef. Good.Overall pretty good choice for semi authentic Chinese food. The service and vibe was excellent and they serve food fast, which I appreciate.",

We went Father's Day Sunday, and were able to get a table for five after about 20 minutes of waiting.The food was amazing! My son got chicken chow mein, with no vegetables. Considering there was a lack of vegetables, it was still delicious.I got the Three Musketeers lomein and was very pleased. It had a nice balance between the meats and veggies. We got the chicken wings- eat them with the sauce! Having said that, they are spicy, if you don't like spicy, maybe get the sauce of the side. The portions are shareable size! We didn't know and we each got a plate and had plenty to take back to the hotel.The customer service is great. Can't wait to come back to California, and est there again.Parking: There is parking behind the restaurant, however, it's a small alley that you will miss unless you know it's there. Across the street there is also a parking garage which you will also miss unless the entrance is there. There is parking in other locations, but you will have to do some walking.",

It's the same sauce for everything.They cook all the meat on one side of the grill and the rest of the food on another grill. The sushi is made in the kitchen/behind the cashier.Depending on when you get your food, you may need to wait a while (~20 mins) until they cook a batch of chicken - even though you may spot some cooked chicken on standby to be placed on a tray.The waiting line is like an assembly line - you order & pay and roughly follow your tray on the bar holder above the grill. They may or may not call your order # so I think it's better to roughly guess which tray is yours and follow it.",

It\u2019s not bad or anything, but you might not expect it. The menu might also come of as strange for people who aren\u2019t used to very hipster style food. Luckily, I\u2019m used to it. I ordered the 8 hour bolognese. When they slow cook tagliatelle for 8 hours, you know that it\u2019s gonna be good! It was surprisingly one of the best pasta dishes I\u2019ve ever had! Plus, the fries are OUTSTANDING (I tried my dad\u2019s fries). However, DO NOT SKIP DESSERT! All of them are incredible. I got the Coconut-Guava Roche. It\u2019s basically coconut and guava mousse with bits of tapioca and gelatine. It was AWESOME! So was my brother\u2019s S\u2019mores Sundae (marshmallow flavoured ice cream with toasted marshmallows and graham crackers) and my parents\u2019 Carrot Cake (not what you\u2019d expect a carrot cake to look like, but don\u2019t let it fool you!)!

Service is always friendly, unlike the lack of cellphone service you\u2019ll have in the building itself but that only adds to enjoyment of eating when you don\u2019t have to worry about anyone calling to disrupt you (unless of course if you have Verizon). I do like the ranch/barn/stable look of the restaurant with the dim lights and long mysterious hallways, always making it difficult to find where your family/party is sitting if arriving late, the plus is that it makes it more intimate for those special date nights. They have a banquet room for larger parties and a full bar with tables for those who do not want to wait to be seated, bar seating is first come first serve basis. When I do eat here I usually get the beef ribs, as it is very difficult to find restaurants that serve beef ribs. I also get the rib eye steak (cowboy steak). Always delicious selections.

Ordered gobhi Manchurian dry, beer and mango kesar as they don\u2019t have mango lassi. Gobhi Manchurian was sour like other Indian restaurants in bay area coz they make it in tomato sauce here instead of soy sauce so I didn\u2019t complain, mango kesar was quite good. While having appetizers , we ordered main course of dal Bukhara/Veg biryani & a garlic naan , we waited , waited & waited and informed our server about the delay as our toddler was hungry & getting restless , he went to check inside. Tables left & right to us were occupied later but got their orders before us , I think our food was served to table left to us who probably ordered similar options as there was some confusion , then we again ask our server who again went to kitchen and brings our food , probably good 25 minutes after we had ordered main course . Dal Bukhara was decent, not too creamy but kinda light in flavor but veg biryani was pretty underwhelming, it was full of semi-cooked carrots and lacking any kinda good flavor, garlic naan was good. I am usually not the one to complain but paying 16 bucks for such a bland pulao like biryani & 18 bucks for a simple dal bukhara makes you wonder your life choices, may be I should have sent the biryani back. My wife then told our main server that it was my birthday so he said he will check if he can get something but later on he did not come with any confirmation and just asked if we need anything else, I replied to him no. We wondered if they gonna get some dessert for us. My wife again asks another server about the same who then returns with a litchi dessert and tells us that please let us know in advance about any special occasion, we said okay and my wife pays the bill and adds around 25% tip , total of around a little under 100 bucks. In the end our main server comes and asks me how was the food , I told him honestly it was just okay , nothing special , I told him Yellow Chilli in Santa Clara has much tastier food with better quality. He apologized and gave excuse of it being a very busy night and to please visit again so that he can take good care next time and handed me a $10 off coupon on dine in for future use. I don\u2019t think we will visit again as it wasn\u2019t the worth the money & hype, at the end it was just a mehhh experience on a special day.PS: I didn\u2019t click any pics as food had already got delayed and we were hungry.",

I was expecting the breading of the onion rings to have at least a hint of Parmesan. My wife did like her clam chowder and baked potato.

So, of course, I didn't miss the chance to try it here. I must say, the calamari was unbelievably delicious, especially when paired with the Hazy IPA that I ordered. The combination was a match made in heaven. Additionally, I decided to indulge in a pizza, opting for a half portion of \"The Cats\" pizza and half portion of \"The Billy Jones\" pizza. I appreciated that they accommodated my request, and both pizzas were truly delightful.One notable aspect of the restaurant is its size. It is incredibly spacious, with around ten tables inside and a significant area dedicated to Bocce game lines. Furthermore, there is a generous outdoor area, providing ample seating for guests to enjoy their meals in a comfortable setting.",

Sushi is tasty and visually appealing.

It was so heartwarming to see them lounging around, playing with toys, and interacting with visitors. The staff did a fantastic job of ensuring the cats' well-being and making sure they were comfortable and happy.The service at the cat cafe was top-notch. The staff members were incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, and passionate about the cats.

Despite having several cats roaming around, the place was impeccably clean and well-maintained.

Possibly only worth stopping by if you're passing to or from Santa Cruz.The meat is on the dry side and quite flavourless. Lots of color but not a lot of substance. I found myself dunking it in the spicy BBQ sauce to make it edible. It was also a bit on the cold side. Sides were great though! Would recommend the chili. That side was eons better than the meat.The portion size is decent for the price, not much to comment on there.Service is a mixed bag. Some friendly folk and some that look like they hate their job.Live music was ok, but doesn't really increase the appeal for this spot.Overall, a questionable experience. Nothing horrible, just nothing particular positive either.",

One of my classmates recommended this restaurant for its value and taste. Citing \"Some of the best biryani, I've had in the US\". But I didn't really trust this guy\u2019s opinion because he doesn't like lamb, pork or fish (Most likely because he's from a vegetarian household). He only likes chicken (Guess what Biryani meat he ordered).But me being a trusting classmate decided to take up his statement of \"Best Biryani I've had since coming to the US\" and ordered the non-vegetarian thali deal. And my lord, was it amazing for the price! It came with some curry, appetizer, naan, gulab jamun (albeit only one), a drink (butter milk? didn't like) , and an amazing biryani. The biryani truly stood up to being some of the best biryani in the US. I am originally from Minnesota and the Indian food scene there is lacking to say the least. Nevertheless, Arka Indian cuisine had an amazing deal with some awesome taste.The curry was good, and the parotta (I think, Indian bread names are confusing) was nice and crispy. The only thing that disappointed me was the singular gulab jamun and the butter milk. The butter milk was understandable I didn't grow up drinking fermented dairy products, so I am unused to it. But ONLY ONE GULAB JAMUN WHAT IS THIS!!!Overall: Great price, great quantity and taste.Con: One gulab jamun... -.59.2/10",

Pretty basic order for us, but a good baseline to measure against other restaurants.  Mild spice on the chicken, ordered medium on the aloo ghobi.   Was all fresh and delicious.  Aloo ghobi was a bit past medium spice for me, but lots fresh veggies and not overloaded with potatoes as I have had elsewhere.  Garlic naan was good, rice that came with entrees was plentiful and good quality.  At $36, was in range to slightly cheaper than other restaurants in the area. A good price for a good amount of food and great quality.  Give it a shot, it\u2019s worth it.",

Das Sushi ist wirklich frisch und lecker, und man merkt, dass viel Wert auf die Qualit\u00e4t der Zutaten gelegt wird. Besonders die Auswahl an verschiedenen Sushi-Rollen, Nigiri und Sashimi hat mich \u00fcberzeugt \u2013 es gibt sowohl Klassiker als auch kreative Eigenkreationen. Die Portionen sind gut bemessen, und man wird definitiv satt.Ein weiteres Highlight ist der Lieferservice. Die Bestellung kam p\u00fcnktlich und war sch\u00f6n verpackt, sodass alles frisch und appetitlich ankam. Gerade, wenn man mal keine Zeit hat, ins Restaurant zu gehen, ist die Lieferoption super praktisch. Auch im Laden selbst ist die Atmosph\u00e4re angenehm und freundlich, wenn man vor Ort essen m\u00f6chte.Der einzige kleine Kritikpunkt ist, dass die Auswahl an warmen Speisen etwas gr\u00f6\u00dfer sein k\u00f6nnte. Abgesehen davon gibt es an Qualit\u00e4t und Geschmack nichts auszusetzen.Insgesamt ein toller Sushi-Laden mit gutem Service und einem zuverl\u00e4ssigen Lieferservice.

Service and prices are so-so (be forewarned: you do have to pay extra for rice, which is rather strange). One of the best things about the restaurant is that the kitchen is actually capable/willing to adjust spice levels all the way from true \"gringo mild\" to ultra-fiery (be sure to put the TP in the freezer for tomorrow morning).",

Fried calamari was above average but still a bit chewy. The Antipasti Misto had too much cured meats and not enough veggies for my liking. Wish they continued to offer the toasted polenta (saw it in one of the menu photos). Spinach salad was good. Of the mains, the Lobster Ravioli was a bit fishy (tasted like defrosted seafood not fresh), the Scallopine alla Les (veal with brandy cream sauce) failed to let the brandy stand out in a smother of sauce - though the veal was very tender, as veal tend to be. The Specialita di Barbara (seafood on bed of salad) was very good. We had the Tiramisu & Vanilla Gelato. Both were very good and the combo was excellent.

Unfortunately the Spring '19 menu did not meet this high bar, and it is with some consternation that I write this less-than-perfect review, because our experience here was quite wonderful.So let's begin with all that the Restaurant had done right -- the ambiance, the location, and especially the SERVICE. The Restaurant at Meadowood is itself nestled within the resort, up a short but scenic tree-lined drive. The gate man, the valet, the host were all very friendly and attentive, and we were promptly ushered into a calming and serene location -- exposed wood, solid stone, leather chairs, perfectly placed lighting, Zalto glasses, and even a faux tree. The service staff was superb, wonderful (but also appropriate) wine recommendations by the Somm, followed by a consistent and delicate dance of 6 plates hitting the table within 10 seconds during each of the 16+ times they were served and subsequently cleared -- mesmerizing to watch. Also important, taxes and gratuity are included (and the staff helpfully mentioned this again at the end of the meal), saves one from the anxiety and mental gymnastics of calculating a living wage subsidy, guilty of not doing it properly, or the regret of overdoing it.TL;DR: this place was fancy a-f, and tasteful at it.But alas, the crux of Michelin's guide (which navigated us here), is one based in cuisine, and the majority of the dishes left something to be desired. The theme, for the Spring '19 menu, is likely one rooted in ingredients, farm-to-table, hyper-local, [insert buzzword], there is no presentation, no flair, no frills, no pizzazz -- which is something we have grown accustomed to with Michelin \"destinations\" -- a Disneyland for your mouth; a Broadway play for your palate. This ... was much more simple. Perhaps zen?Prior to the meal, a basket of fresh vegetables was brought out -- perhaps the same that went into our dishes? We were not sure. On asking why the asparagus is white, the presenter just rehearsed the same line (but I Googled it -- it was because it was sun/chlorophyll deprived -- by growing completely submerged in soil or covering with a tarp, the result is a more fibrous and milder ... asparagus).The dishes were brought out one by one, properly spaced, interjected with the few bottles of aptly paired wines we had ordered. However, few were particularly memorable: 1. the salad roll tasted... green; 2. the baby potatoes tasted... like my garden potatoes; 3. the beignet chestnut had a good texture; 4. the miso oyster nasturtium (a perennial weed) was fresh; 5. the white asparagus was cooked and chilled to perfection, the pacific rock crab and wild onion flavorful; 6. the escabeche of broccoli clams tasted of al dente broccoli, and fine textured clams; 7. the caviar smoked tendon cultured butter sabayon was DELICIOUS, like a perfectly integrated red wine it just all melded together -- this was the single dish we probably came for; 8. abalone and cabbage, meh; 9. local sole cover crop, meh; 10. duck tea followed by pekin duck, had much better in Beijing, the risotto (specifically noted that it was made with CA rice! i.e. Cal-rose which accounts for more than 90% of rice consumed in the US?) was on the salty side and did not quite showcase the duck; 11. the slow cooked pork collar, interesting kohlrabi texture but taste was lacking; 12. black truffle veined blue cheese with beeswax pear and charter oak bread -- this screamed \"lazy chef\", the blue cheese completely overpowered any truffle aroma, olfactory or taste; 13. yogurt cultured with almond blossoms rhubarb sorrels - not sure what the almond flowers did for this dish, but the presentation was somewhat pretty, tasted like yogurt; 14. bay leaf ice cream with a chocolate ball over a bay leaf sprig - good and unique ice cream flavor, perfect texture; 15. last bites - cute box, but snacks were reminiscent of Asian grocery store knick knacks.In sum... good food? Yes. \"Exceptional cuisine that is worth a special journey?\" No.",

The parking can be a bit difficult if there is another event like a wedding taking place at the same time.

After the meal we were even invited to tour the amazing kitchen and found out that you can have a special meal in there!We had a huge variety of dishes, many of which were the best of their kind among all the great restaurants we have been to. Like others have mentioned in their reviews the desserts are not quite up to par with the rest of the meal. The Oil Oil Pudding we had was great, but the candied garden was not special.Why not 5 stars? Certainly the meal and experience at the restaurant were 5 star quality, however my wife had severe stomach issues after the meal.

It's the same sauce for everything.They cook all the meat on one side of the grill and the rest of the food on another grill. The sushi is made in the kitchen/behind the cashier.Depending on when you get your food, you may need to wait a while (~20 mins) until they cook a batch of chicken - even though you may spot some cooked chicken on standby to be placed on a tray.The waiting line is like an assembly line - you order & pay and roughly follow your tray on the bar holder above the grill. They may or may not call your order # so I think it's better to roughly guess which tray is yours and follow it.",

The garlic naan was absolutely perfect, and the mango lasse, and not from a mix.Talking with Krishna who is a delightful host, she explained some of the principles of New Delhi cuisine to me, and how she had pride in her restaurant and her food, and it shows.

I've had a lot of great pasta dishes in my life (flour & water and Cotogna in San Francisco, Piccola Cucina Estiatorio in New York, and the best places in Italy)... the Fettucine at Mountain House is the best pasta dish I've ever had, period.My Vieux Carre cocktail was perfectly diluted and mixed with care.  Really delicious.  The wine list is well crafted with a lot of great options and the wine markup is low  (they had a 1986 Mouton Rothschild that retails at $1000 for $1250).The atmosphere is remarkable.

It's new owners have sustained it as a place worth the drive.Walking in from the redwood forest, you enter into the bar room, appointed in an immaculately rustic style. Custom and traditional cocktails await you. I was surprised to find a milk punch being served; the bartender and I chatted about the lengthy process one must go through to craft such a beverage. My wife enjoyed that libation while I drank their riff on the classic Churchill, with a burnt cinnamon stick in place of a cigar.If I wanted to take visitors to a scenic bar for a drink, the Mountain House has already justified its presence.However, the star attraction is dinner within the Forest Room. Elevated thirty feet from the forest floor, with walls and ceiling made of glass, one is treated to dining within the redwoods. I would recommend waiting up to an hour for a table within this very special environment.The food is good and the prix-fixe is at the lower end of a fine dining experience. We both enjoyed the roast quail starter -- truly, the star of our meal. My wife enjoyed the short ribs, while I had a decent venison rack. For desert, she enjoyed something off menu -- a wonderful fusion of pecan pie, chocolate cake, and tarte. Mine, a peach galette was just a mess of dense dough with little fruit.The service was nice, helpful, though inexperienced, with the exception of the bartenders. Without the atmosphere or location, this is probably a place you'd go to once, enjoy, but never make a return trip. But add those elements in, and you'll happily go back.",

The filet minion, duck breast, grilled quail, and foie gras were all excellent. The dishes in general were well constructed with an interesting mix of ingredients complementing the centerpieces well. The trend in utilizing some more local variations on mainstays added unique flair to each one.Drinks were pretty strong and fairly creative. It is worth getting a cocktail or two.If we may offer a critique: we felt the dessert course was a little weak. The Panna Cotta was bit overpowered by the passion fruit jelly topping, and the Hazelnut Tart while good, was not really outstanding in any way.We do plan on visiting again, overall the meal was compelling, so I'm pretty excited to explore their day to day menu.Edit Apr 2024:Had my family birthday dinner here with 8 and it was truly a memorable meal. Service was excellent. We were accidentally served sour wine but they of course quickly corrected this graciously. The food came out all fabulously. Personally I was fascinated by the stuffed quail made somehow boneless except for legs and wings. The rack of venison was uniquely herbaceous. My favorite dish I tried was the scallops, exceptionally fresh presented on a savory background of roasted onion. \ud83d\ude0bEveryone was well impressed by the meal and I'm sure we'll all be back in the future.Vegetarian options: Decent options for vegetarians, but most of the selections involves meat or fish.Parking: A parking lot exists, but it is not well paved as it fits within the trees.

All that is missing is a sticky rice chicken.The workers are pretty rude and they prefer you to order from their carts for obvious reasons. The managers are quite perfunctory as well.

The hospitality is really good and they take each order and make it so it would take time but you will get your food which tastes good. They also offer the Indian spice level which normally people say in other restaurants that we would have Indian spice but they taper down usually but here in this restaurant we can explicitly mention the hottest spice and they will cater to our requirement.Rumali roti , I am a big fan of this kind of bread but I could not find a proper place that serves this bread. This is the place where you get the 85% of the traditional taste of the bread variant. I would recommend this.I am a vegetarian and I like the taste here.My friend tried Goat Biryani and we taste a lot of food in the area nearby and he said this would be the best goat biryani in the surrounding area.Starters really shine with the proper spice and taste.Please mention your spice level appropriately when they ask as the Indian spice would be too hot but may be you can say them to make it mild or spicy based on your choice.The salt quantity could be also mentioned while ordering the food. As they tend to taper down the salt in the food to appeal to majority of people who are getting health conscious.Finally it\u2019s a good placeVegetarian options: There is a decent selection of vegetarian options. And the good part is we can order catering and they follow the Indian tradition and cook accordingly is what I got the work from the person I spoke to.Parking: It is a typical restaurant and it has decent parking in the complex itself.

All of the portions are meant for sharing, which is why they have separate plates and serving spoons, but if you're alone, it's fine to eat out of the bowls the food comes in. I had the tea leaf salad, chicken curry with rice, and Burmese milk tea. The tea leaf salad is an acquired taste and I didn't like it, but it was flavorful and the tea leaves are imported because they can't be found in the US, according to the manager. The chicken curry was perfectly seasoned and the chicken was extremely tender. You could shred it with a spoon. The jasmine rice was perfectly cooked. The Burmese milk tea was the perfect temperature and really tasty. There were a lot of other drinks as well, with alcohol.Overall, I highly recommend visiting this restaurant.

Though it's not bad - my first order was a beef bento and I'll never order that again!You can ask for more veggies vs rice. You can also ask for more sauce once you get your order. It's the same sauce for everything.They cook all the meat on one side of the grill and the rest of the food on another grill. The sushi is made in the kitchen/behind the cashier.Depending on when you get your food, you may need to wait a while (~20 mins) until they cook a batch of chicken - even though you may spot some cooked chicken on standby to be placed on a tray.The waiting line is like an assembly line - you order & pay and roughly follow your tray on the bar holder above the grill. They may or may not call your order # so I think it's better to roughly guess which tray is yours and follow it.",

I was passing through town on my way to Portland and decided to meet up with an ex boyfriend after 25+ years.  We knew we wanted Castro district so our first choice was The Anchor Oyster Bar, but it was closed due to Covid 19 so then we went to Hamburger Mary\u2019s which was also closed. I didn\u2019t have Italian on my mind, but I\u2019m glad we ended up at The Sausage Factory.  The food was excellent and it has an antique charm that makes it truly unique.  After telling some of my friends in the city about it they all sort of responded with\u201dOh that place.  It hasn\u2019t changed much in 40 years.\u201d  Well, guess what?  If something\u2019s good, why change it?We started with mussels in a garlic sauce that were out of this world.  Not exactly sure what was in the sauce to make it green, but I loved it so much I took a spoon to it after all the mussels and toasted garlic bread were gone.  I was going to get the puttanesca, but I always get puttanesca at authentic Italian restaurants so I went with the chicken piccata.  I was not disappointed.  The lemon-caper sauce had just the right amount of tang and the chicken was so tender, there was no need to use a knife.  My ex had the pasta primavera served with an alfredo sauce which looked awesome, but I didn\u2019t try it.  He said it was good, but couldn\u2019t finish it because he was full.  I, of course, never stop until it\u2019s all gone if I think it\u2019s good; full or not.  Maybe that\u2019s just another difference between him and me. Sigh.Everything about it was delightful. The server and food runner were very upbeat, fun, and efficient, and the food was great.  If you\u2019re in the Castro and want good, authentic Italian cuisine, go to The Sausage Factory.",

I asked to brush some butter on top of naan.- Kadai paneer was good in taste and goes well with garlic naan.Finally, dessert time. No matter how full you are, there is always a room for desserts \ud83d\ude01 We had Rasmalai sweet.

It's the same sauce for everything.They cook all the meat on one side of the grill and the rest of the food on another grill. The sushi is made in the kitchen/behind the cashier.Depending on when you get your food, you may need to wait a while (~20 mins) until they cook a batch of chicken - even though you may spot some cooked chicken on standby to be placed on a tray.The waiting line is like an assembly line - you order & pay and roughly follow your tray on the bar holder above the grill. They may or may not call your order # so I think it's better to roughly guess which tray is yours and follow it.",

This restaurant, however, hit all the right notes.Their sushi selection, despite being vegetarian, was diverse and delicious. Each piece was a work of art, both in taste and in presentation. It\u2019s hard to find vegetarian sushi that feels both authentic and inventive, but they\u2019ve managed to do just that.The noodles were equally impressive. I had a bowl that was both hearty and bursting with layers of flavor. It was clear that a lot of thought and care went into preparing each dish, using fresh ingredients that truly shone through in each bite.Service was impeccable, with staff who were friendly and knowledgeable, making the dining experience even more enjoyable. The ambiance of the restaurant was cozy and inviting, perfect for both casual meals and special occasions.I can\u2019t recommend this restaurant enough to anyone looking for outstanding vegetarian sushi and noodles.

They were everything I dreamed of. Light, super fluffy, the syrup and berry compote were just right and the berries tasted so fresh.Another thing worth noting is their $5 orange juice. It tastes like biting into a perfectly ripened orange!We had a server with red hair help us, she was friendly, attentive, welcoming. This place deserves all the stars!

I then ordered the Me Hungry meal, because I wanted to try the fried rice and the chicken satay. The chicken was cooked perfectly, and mixed with the sauce and rice it was filling, but not heavy. Made for a very nice late lunch meal. I also ordered the fried bananas and ice cream, and that was delicious as well. I definitely will be back to try something new next time.

The line moved pretty fast and the check-in/security process was streamlined. It was our first time in Hakkasan so we were surprised we had to take an elevator up to get to the club. They only opened 2 floors so we didn't get to see the 3rd one. The floor we got off on was the top floor where it was all lounge seating. The bar area was big and provided a nice overview of the club. The space in front of the DJ was huge but it was already filled. We grabbed a drink first since there was no line which was a smart choice because half an hour later, both bars were packed. It was ladies' open bar too from 11:30 PM - 12:30 AM so the girls can get free well drinks/beers. HOWEVER, the drinks - even the paid ones - tasted like juice with barely any alcohol in them. The lemon drop was $20 and the long island tea was $26 too so pre-game before you come in. The lemon drop we got had sugar all over the cup so our hands got sticky. The bartenders were really nice though and didn't seem to hate their jobs. The music got better as it got later into the night but we left a little before 1 AM since it got way too crowded. They even blocked off the middle entry stairs to the main stage dance floor and had security managing path of travel/flow. Overall, had a pretty good experience. Definitely one of the better clubs I've been to.Parking: Parking is at MGM Grand.",

With a display of hanging roast duck and pork, immediately your eyes are treated with savory meats.  Their quick serve dishes, usually includes BBQ meats are front and center behind a glass partitioned kitchen.  The actual kitchen where they prep most of the dishes are behind what the customers can see.  Those dishes definitely do not disappoint.  The portions are substantial matching the steep pricing.  We paid close to $80 for 3 dishes.  In the end, they served us a warm red bean dessert for free.  We ordered a BBQ sampler over rice to share family style.  We also ordered Crispy Fried Fish & Pumpkin, and House Special Crispy Chow Mein.  The food was delicious.  I can't wait for us to return and try other dishes.",

The business specializes in Japanese pancakes, Okonomiyaki, and a few other specific side dishes. Wait list can be long as the business is small and gets busy really fast. I would recommend coming in early right when it opens as the business is not your usual 9 to 5 hours of operation; it opens around 5 30 pm.Portion and quality of the dish is good, a bit saucey and hidden meat portions with a large portion of vegetables. If you like to eat, I would say it's just enough for you to be content a for the duration of your stay. However, if you wanted to eat another dish, you can easily order another without getting too full. Service was lacking as the waiters and waitress' had to perform multiple roles to ensure customer service. However, being that the place is busy, they overlook the basic service of asking the customer the quality of the meal, refilling water, and having ready to-go containers of any left overs. I felt the establishment lacked service, thus 1 star taken away.I would come again but given the circumstances of their limited hours, long wait times, and somewhat small portions - in my perspective, I'm not too inclined to make this my priority.

He checked in on us and made sure all of our food was correct when it was brought out to us. They didn't mess up a single order.I ordered a beergarita (pictured), honey had a regular and others at the table had mango margaritas. The regular margarita glass was smaller than the mango margaritas. All of the margs we're meh. Nothing to call and Uber over.When trying new Mexican restaurants always start with the carne asada, if their carne asada is not strong, the menu won't be strong either.I had the steak wet burrito and honey had the steak, chicken, and shrimp fajitas. The fajitas came with a lot of veggies and they were good too. Both were good and tasted familiar. Someone in another review said it good enough to go back but nothing to crave and I couldn't agree more.Once we left we found out the same owners of Metro Taqueria own this place.

Some of my personal favorite items I tried were the Pesto pasta, as well as the Risotto alla Milanese (though would've prefered if the Risotto came with the Milanese Veal too).

So, I broke my gluten-free diet and opted for Linquini  & Clams without garlic butter. Both dishes were well made, well plated and very enjoyable. To finish, my partner ordered Apple of Your Eye for desert.",

She gave me the perfect color for my skin tone and the tan made me feel 10x better about my skin!

First, Sonya is so welcoming and made me feel so comfortable with the entire process. There are a lot of step when getting a spray tan from the prep to the aftercare. Sonya made all the information easy to understand and accessible. When I arrived, we discussed what color I wanted and what additives were available - I decided to try the warm vanilla scent and an anti-aging serum. During the treatment, she was precise and professional with each step. The aftercare was clear and easy to keep up with. It has been a week since I received my spray tan and I am obsessed! It was perfect from day 1 and it looks natural (which is what I wanted!). One of the most difficult areas to avoid the tell-tale signs of a spray tan is the hands/wrists and she did an amazing application on them. I left wearing one of her after-tan dresses and it was so nice to not have to worry about transferring my tan on my car seats or couch before bed! I highly recommend Bronze Buddha Glow & all the extras that I mentioned above. Get yourself the dress - you won\u2019t regret it!",

The second server seemed to have an attitude but became more polite as the meal continued. All in all the food was good and the service was good.I have 3 stars because of the bathroom. The rest of the restaurant was great. I will say that I did complain the first day that the bathrooms stink something awful. I didn't even go into the restroom the 2nd visit. I told them that it smelled like a porta potty that had been sitting in the hot sun, in New Orleans, during Mardi Gras, used by thousands of people. That's not an exaggeration. It was awful. They were aware of the situation and said that they were working on it but nothing had been done yet. I react to air fresheners but that would have been better than the stinky smell.Dietary restrictions: Gluten free",

I typically cover areas such as atmosphere, customer service, and the food itself when reviewing restaurants, cafes, and the like.Atmosphere:It\u2019s just like any Macaroni Grill back in the states. It looks the same, the employees dress the same, and it even sounds the same. I was very comfortable the entire time I was there and encountered no issues with my surroundings.Customer service:My waitress was very attentive during my meal and constantly checked in on me for drink refills or to ask if I needed anything. All the employees here maintain a positive attitude and take special care in making sure you have a good experience.Food:The food here is very good and isn\u2019t too pricey for what you get. The bread they serve is delicious and bottomless (as are the soft drinks and iced tea). The appetizers are great but I feel as though the main entrees could have a larger variety. Still, you get what you pay for and it is worth it.Miscellaneous:In order to save time, it is recommended you call and make a reservation. They only accept same-day reservations sadly and if you walk in without one you may have to wait around an hour to be seated. Not an issue if you decide to shop at the BX beforehand.Overall, a very good place to grab an Italian meal while on base.",

They have a ton of spacious tables perfect for family-style dining, and our service was fantastic. The staff was friendly, attentive, and kept our water glasses full throughout the meal.Unfortunately, the food itself was a bit of a mixed bag. The Vegetarian Manchurian house special had a decent sauce, but the Manchurian itself was a bit soggy on the inside. It felt like it had been sitting in sauce for a bit too long. The egg fried rice with BBQ pork was another letdown. The rice was undercooked, and the BBQ pork itself was bland and lacked the smoky sweetness you would expect.The hot iron plate style chicken had so much potential, but the execution fell flat. They put the chicken on top of the crispy rice, which sounds good in theory, but it meant the rice got soggy almost immediately. By the time you got to the rice, it was all mushy.Overall, Crouching Tiger is a good option for a large group with friendly service, but the food needs some work. I'd recommend sticking with simpler dishes and maybe skipping the sizzling plate options.",

Secondly, the food is priced very well, nothing on the menu seems overpriced at all, so very affordable.Thirdly, everything I have had here is delish!What I pictured is the falafel plate which comes with four and some fresh veggies.I also got the saffron chicken plate, which came with rice on the side. The rice had a nice hint of fragrance and paired fantastic with the chicken and the sauce. The chicken itself just about melted in my mouth, and the sauce was very flavorful.You can also go here in the morning to mid lunch times for their buffet which is an incredible way to try the majority of their dishes! I asked the waitress when I was here on a Sunday and she mentioned that Sunday buffets end at 3:00pm. If you haven\u2019t been here at all , I highly recommend you try the buffet first, and enjoy your experience here cause that\u2019s what you\u2019ll have!",

Although the baklava's base was slightly firmer than ideal but it was delicious.This marked my second visit to Amoura, during my previous visit, I tried their cheesecake that was so good.Service was comparatively better than last year, with the team being attentive and accommodating throughout the evening. Despite the large group, the staff efficiently managed the catering, ensuring everyone enjoyed seamless dining experience.Overall, Amoura Restaurant offered a delightful experience, highly recommended if you're looking for a space to arrange a large gathering.Parking: First come first serve",

The mango salad didn't seem to have too much mango, but was really refreshing. It was a good starter. The platha was also really good. The dip had pieces of meat in it too. The eggplant with chicken was cooked really well. This was our favorite dish of the meal. The sesame tofu was cut up pretty small and the sauce was similar to a sweet and sour sauce. Wasn't a favorite, but good enough. The curry had a lot of meat and would have gone really well with rice.While we didn't love all the food, it was good. If you want burmese food in this area, this place is definitely affordable and has decent food. We would probably come back.",

My grandfather passed and his waiter was at his funeral. He has since retired but there are still amazing waiters that really take good care of you. So the service is amazing.The drinks are also yummy. I ordered a lemon drop (or 2 \ud83d\ude09 \ud83c\udf4b \ud83c\udf79) which was sooo good and my husband ordered a \"Flawless\" . So good. But my husband liked his first one better and I noticed there were fruit garnishes on our second round so the bartenders must have changed.My husband and I split a ceaser salad which we devoured. They split the plate automatically for us without asking and added black pepper to our taste. Perfect service.I ordered the salmon special which honestly the salmon was brilliantly cooked and yummy but didn't pair that well with the citrus dressing and greens topping it. I ate half of it and the rest of my grandma's John Dory. The John Dory is the best fing thing on this menu. You MUST order this dish. Or at the very least someone at your table willing to share. Thanks Gram! The sauce it's paired with is incredible and comes with the halibut too because my aunt order the parm encrusted halibut and she got the sauce. Hers was incredible too! Let's see.. My husband ordered a ribeye with mashed potatoes. Yes yes yes! I got one delicious \ud83d\ude0b bite. And it was the best bite ever. My daughter got a kids size steak filet and after finishing it she ate some of the ribeye. She is a sucker for good steak. My son got mac and cheese and he's a Kraft fan so he wasn't impressed with the rotini shape and sauce.. But we were! We took it to go and ate it later. It was tasty. My great aunt ordered a prawn pasta she liked it. I could tell she'd ordered it before. I saw another person with it too so it's a popular dish.Lastly on the food.. You'll definitely definitely want to save room in your belly and wallet for dessert, because this is where our Texas sized appetites were satiated. The portions are huge! We ordered a key lime pie, cheesecake and hot fudge sundae. My son got the hot fudge sundae (yes even after his meager attempt at his mac and cheese), but you have never seen a happier little boy in your life. There was a huge amount of whip cream atop the chocolate ice cream and then you get a little gravy boat full of hot fudge; he was having the best time pouring it on top. His face lit up! Get your child this sundae or be a kid again and get it for yourself. My aunt and gram shared with him but he ate a lot of it. My daughter and great Aunt shared the keylime pie and OMG ITS THE BEST DANG key lime pie you've ever had. And we've been the the Florida keys and had plenty of their pie but this was better. Even my husband who doesn't care for it as much as my daughter and I, loved it. The portion looked was 2 slices in 1. It's creamy and not too sweet and the gram cracker crust is just perfect. My husband and I split the cheesecake bc he loves cheesecake. It was dense and perfectly made. But I need more than the little strawberry puree they put on the plate. My husband is a purest and loved it as is. Any critique I have is really my own taste preference and not the restaurant's quality. I know from eating there before that they will adjust anything you ask based on your tastes. Pan seared vs grilled, more sauce etc..I mean this restaurant is top notch. It's been my grandparent's favorite since my childhood. Things come and go in Beverly hills but this restaurant is a staple.You get what you pay for! This place is pricey but not in an exorbitant kind of way. You will be happy to pay the prices once you experience the quality of service and food and atmosphere. If you want a good dinner by Rodeo Drive, this is the place!People wear jeans and shirts here so no need to dress up but we always look nice when we go here.Takeaways: if you like seafood, try the John Dory. Dress nice but not up and order the key lime pie if you're a fan. Kid friendly!",

The place had been on my list since the time they had a Michelin star.Since we had vegetarian people at the table, we started with an Eggplant (zaalouk), an Eggshuka, their Milk Bread, and the Salmon.The zaalouk was this nice concoction of eggplant, tomatoes, spices, and tahini. It comes with some decadent flatbread that's like brioche, but butter. Cannot recommend enough.The Eggshuka is a refined take on the traditional shakshuka. It was made with extremely whipped egg whites as the crust, hen yolks in the middle, and the usual tomatoes/spices/peppers underneath. I was impressed with how in sync with flavors were of these perceptible layers.The salmon was plated well but I did not think of it as highly, and really recall what it made me think of :/The Milk Bread might be the best form of carbs i've had this year, seriously. It is pillowy, sweet, and pairs incredibly well with the accompanying butters (peppered honey, lemon, pomegranate).Next we got the Lamb, Heirloom Beans, and the Couscous. The lamb was cooked medium well, and had a satisfying bite. The beans were huge, and cooked to a smooth consistency. The couscous was topped with gooseberry and almonds- unusual but a great combo that went down easy.Our server gave us great recommendations, the staff was attentive. The food took a while to prepare, but that was my only gripe. The ambiance is great, and the interior is gorgeous.8/10 would go back again!",

The bartender was multitasking, attending to both the floor and the bar, making it hard to read her mood. The service, while not unwelcoming, lacked the usual warmth and friendliness I've grown accustomed to here. The scent of sizzling fajitas and spicy salsa wafted through the air, causing my stomach to growl in anticipation. I observed the bartender skillfully mixing drinks, her hands moving swiftly and accurately. I pondered what had shifted in this once vibrant eatery. Was it recent staff changes or the economic downturn affecting business? Whatever the cause, the atmosphere was undeniably altered today. Despite the subdued vibe, I still found peace in the familiar setting. The cozy booths, vibrant decorations, and delectable food all served as a reminder of why I kept returning to this place. Even on a quiet day like today, I knew I could rely on this restaurant for a moment of tranquility and relaxation. For a brief moment, I was able to escape and listen to an audiobook. As I completed my meal and settled the bill, I mentally noted to return soon. Despite the alterations, this place remained dear to my heart, and I felt assured of a warm welcome whenever I visited. Leaving the restaurant, I felt content and appreciative of the brief escape from the daily hustle and bustle. Despite recent menu cutbacks, I still felt drawn to this establishment whenever I needed to unwind and clear my mind.

On The Border response, makes me feel grateful that I had decided to tip the bartender generously to bring some joy to her day. Sometimes, a little kindness during imperfect moments can bring happiness and brighten our day.I believe that it's important to acknowledge and appreciate when a business takes the time to address feedback and make improvements. It shows that they truly care about their customers' experiences and are dedicated to providing the best service possible. This level of dedication and commitment is what sets On The Border apart from other establishments and makes me want to continue supporting them.By choosing to tip the bartender generously, I wanted to show my gratitude for her hard work and dedication to her job. I know that working in the service industry can be tough, and a little extra kindness and appreciation can go a long way in making someone's day brighter.This experience has reinforced my belief in the power of positivity and kindness, especially during challenging times. It's a reminder that simple acts of appreciation can create a more positive and uplifting environment for everyone involved.

The crab sandwich topped with caviar was a standout, the salmon taco was tasty, and the avocado ball was super creamy! Each bite had its unique charm.\ud83c\udf75 Fruit Platter: I was captivated by the attention to detail. The fruit slices were uniformly thick, with all the stems removed for a smoother texture and a melt-in-your-mouth experience.

I ordered a sandwich with sausage (green chiles are an ingredient) and my partner ordered a half-rack of ribs. We both ordered the fries.The fries were large and wonderful. There were a lot of them. The sandwich was made using delicious bread, not just a simple bun.My girlfriend wasn't fond of the ribs but she still had a good experience. The manager/owner asked us how we were enjoying things and when my partner told her about the ribs, the manager/owner corrected this. We plan on visiting this place again.They also have a selction of beer.Parking: As with other places in Eureka Springs, parking can be difficult. We arrived early so we found parking. At peak times, the parking lot will probably fill up fast.",

My husband and I split the three meat plate that offered two sides and sliced bread for $22 that left us very full. The fries are hand cut and white cheese macaroni also seemed homemade, which both were awesome! We will most definitely be back during our next visit to ES!",

Though it's not bad - my first order was a beef bento and I'll never order that again!You can ask for more veggies vs rice. You can also ask for more sauce once you get your order. It's the same sauce for everything.They cook all the meat on one side of the grill and the rest of the food on another grill. The sushi is made in the kitchen/behind the cashier.Depending on when you get your food, you may need to wait a while (~20 mins) until they cook a batch of chicken - even though you may spot some cooked chicken on standby to be placed on a tray.The waiting line is like an assembly line - you order & pay and roughly follow your tray on the bar holder above the grill. They may or may not call your order # so I think it's better to roughly guess which tray is yours and follow it.",

The portions here are generous, making it an ideal choice for sharing among friends or family. The menu offers a wide variety of dishes, from classic dim sum to hearty mains, all prepared with fresh ingredients and traditional flavors.For solo travelers, the large portions can be a bit overwhelming, and it might be challenging to fully enjoy the variety of dishes on offer. The restaurant's ambiance is warm and inviting, perfect for gatherings and celebrations, but it might feel a bit too much for a lone diner seeking a quick meal.Despite this, the quality of the food and the reasonable pricing make Hakka Restaurant a solid choice for anyone looking to experience hearty Chinese meals in a convivial setting. The service is efficient, and the staff are accommodating, making the dining experience smooth and enjoyable. Overall, it's a fantastic spot for group dining, earning it a well-deserved four stars. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50",

I have had all of the lamb curries, momos, naan, the pastry apetizers and of course the Chicken Tikka Masala.

Definetly worth a visit for the food.The service is where it lacks. Out of the 5 times, 2 were rough experiences, 1 was great and 2 were mediocre. Some servers don't write the order down and have messed up the order a couple times and were just not the best people to interact with. Not to mention one of the experiences I had the server did not seem \"fully aware\" and even said he wouldn't place the order a friend requested for whatever reason and argued with him about it until he complied. That was a one-off experience, however, and to me the food is worth coming back. Also, I've had good interactions, too, more than not.
