            "It was the first garden-tomb on the Indian subcontinent, and is located in Nizamuddin East, Delhi, close to the Dina-panah Citadel, also known as Purana Qila (Old Fort), that Humayun found in 1538.",

            "Much of the intricate moving scenery of the house was designed on site as the project developed.",

            "The house is notable for its splendid architecture, but it may be more well known for another reason.",
            "It was built on the site of a much older building that the patron had purchased and intended to demolish.",
